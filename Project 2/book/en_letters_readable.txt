CHAPTER I

THE GUN CLUB


DURING THE FEDERAL WAR IN THE UNITED STATES A NEW AND VERY INFLUENTIAL
CLUB WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE CITY OF BALTIMORE MARYLAND IT IS WELL
KNOWN WITH WHAT ENERGY THE MILITARY INSTINCT WAS DEVELOPED AMONGST THAT
NATION OF SHIPOWNERS SHOPKEEPERS AND MECHANICS MERE TRADESMEN JUMPED
THEIR COUNTERS TO BECOME EXTEMPORE CAPTAINS COLONELS AND GENERALS
WITHOUT HAVING PASSED THE MILITARY SCHOOL AT WEST POINT THEY SOON
RIVALLED THEIR COLLEAGUES OF THE OLD CONTINENT AND LIKE THEM GAINED
VICTORIES BY DINT OF LAVISHING BULLETS MILLIONS AND MEN

BUT WHERE AMERICANS SINGULARLY SURPASSED EUROPEANS WAS IN THE SCIENCE OF
BALLISTICS OR OF THROWING MASSIVE WEAPONS BY THE USE OF AN ENGINE NOT
THAT THEIR ARMS ATTAINED A HIGHER DEGREE OF PERFECTION BUT THEY WERE OF
UNUSUAL DIMENSIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY OF HITHERTO UNKNOWN RANGES THE
ENGLISH FRENCH AND PRUSSIANS HAVE NOTHING TO LEARN ABOUT FLANK
RUNNING ENFILADING OR POINTBLANK FIRING BUT THEIR CANNON HOWITZERS
AND MORTARS ARE MERE POCKETPISTOLS COMPARED WITH THE FORMIDABLE ENGINES
OF AMERICAN ARTILLERY

THIS FACT OUGHT TO ASTONISH NO ONE THE YANKEES THE FIRST MECHANICIANS
IN THE WORLD ARE BORN ENGINEERS JUST AS ITALIANS ARE MUSICIANS AND
GERMANS METAPHYSICIANS THENCE NOTHING MORE NATURAL THAN TO SEE THEM
BRING THEIR AUDACIOUS INGENUITY TO BEAR ON THE SCIENCE OF BALLISTICS
HENCE THOSE GIGANTIC CANNON MUCH LESS USEFUL THAN SEWINGMACHINES BUT
QUITE AS ASTONISHING AND MUCH MORE ADMIRED THE MARVELS OF THIS STYLE
BY PARROTT DAHLGREN AND RODMAN ARE WELL KNOWN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT
THE ARMSTRONGS PALLISERS AND TREUILLE DE BEAULIEUX BUT TO BOW BEFORE
THEIR TRANSATLANTIC RIVALS

THEREFORE DURING THE TERRIBLE STRUGGLE BETWEEN NORTHERNERS AND
SOUTHERNERS ARTILLERYMEN WERE IN GREAT REQUEST THE UNION NEWSPAPERS
PUBLISHED THEIR INVENTIONS WITH ENTHUSIASM AND THERE WAS NO LITTLE
TRADESMAN NOR NAIF BOOBY WHO DID NOT BOTHER HIS HEAD DAY AND NIGHT
WITH CALCULATIONS ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE TRAJECTORY ENGINES

NOW WHEN AN AMERICAN HAS AN IDEA HE SEEKS ANOTHER AMERICAN TO SHARE IT
IF THEY ARE THREE THEY ELECT A PRESIDENT AND TWO SECRETARIES GIVEN
FOUR THEY ELECT A CLERK AND A COMPANY IS ESTABLISHED FIVE CONVOKE A
GENERAL MEETING AND THE CLUB IS FORMED IT THUS HAPPENED AT BALTIMORE
THE FIRST MAN WHO INVENTED A NEW CANNON TOOK INTO PARTNERSHIP THE FIRST
MAN WHO CAST IT AND THE FIRST MAN THAT BORED IT SUCH WAS THE NUCLEUS OF
THE GUN CLUB ONE MONTH AFTER ITS FORMATION IT NUMBERED EIGHTEEN HUNDRED
AND THIRTYTHREE EFFECTIVE MEMBERS AND THIRTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND
SEVENTYFIVE CORRESPONDING MEMBERS

ONE CONDITION WAS IMPOSED AS A SINE QUA NON UPON EVERY ONE WHO WISHED
TO BECOME A MEMBERTHAT OF HAVING INVENTED OR AT LEAST PERFECTED A
CANNON OR IN DEFAULT OF A CANNON A FIREARM OF SOME SORT BUT TO TELL
THE TRUTH MERE INVENTORS OF FIFTEENBARRELLED RIFLES REVOLVERS OR
SWORDPISTOLS DID NOT ENJOY MUCH CONSIDERATION ARTILLERYMEN WERE ALWAYS
PREFERRED TO THEM IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE

THE ESTIMATION IN WHICH THEY ARE HELD SAID ONE DAY A LEARNED ORATOR
OF THE GUN CLUB IS IN PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THEIR CANNON AND IN
DIRECT RATIO TO THE SQUARE OF DISTANCE ATTAINED BY THEIR PROJECTILES

A LITTLE MORE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEWTONS LAW OF GRAVITATION APPLIED
TO MORAL ORDER

ONCE THE GUN CLUB FOUNDED IT CAN BE EASILY IMAGINED ITS EFFECT UPON THE
INVENTIVE GENIUS OF THE AMERICANS WARENGINES TOOK COLOSSAL
PROPORTIONS AND PROJECTILES LAUNCHED BEYOND PERMITTED DISTANCES CUT
INOFFENSIVE PEDESTRIANS TO PIECES ALL THESE INVENTIONS LEFT THE TIMID
INSTRUMENTS OF EUROPEAN ARTILLERY FAR BEHIND THEM THIS MAY BE ESTIMATED
BY THE FOLLOWING FIGURES

FORMERLY IN THE GOOD OLD TIMES A THIRTYSIX POUNDER AT A DISTANCE
OF THREE HUNDRED FEET WOULD CUT UP THIRTYSIX HORSES ATTACKED IN
FLANK AND SIXTYEIGHT MEN THE ART WAS THEN IN ITS INFANCY
PROJECTILES HAVE SINCE MADE THEIR WAY THE RODMAN GUN THAT SENT A
PROJECTILE WEIGHING HALF A TON A DISTANCE OF SEVEN MILES COULD EASILY
HAVE CUT UP A HUNDRED AND FIFTY HORSES AND THREE HUNDRED MEN THERE WAS
SOME TALK AT THE GUN CLUB OF MAKING A SOLEMN EXPERIMENT WITH IT BUT IF
THE HORSES CONSENTED TO PLAY THEIR PART THE MEN UNFORTUNATELY WERE
WANTING

HOWEVER THAT MAY BE THE EFFECT OF THESE CANNON WAS VERY DEADLY AND AT
EACH DISCHARGE THE COMBATANTS FELL LIKE EARS BEFORE A SCYTHE AFTER SUCH
PROJECTILES WHAT SIGNIFIED THE FAMOUS BALL WHICH AT COUTRAS IN 
DISABLED TWENTYFIVE MEN AND THE ONE WHICH AT ZORNDORFF IN 
KILLED FORTY FANTASSINS AND IN  KESSELDORFS AUSTRIAN CANNON OF
WHICH EVERY SHOT LEVELLED SEVENTY ENEMIES WITH THE GROUND WHAT WAS THE
ASTONISHING FIRING AT JENA OR AUSTERLITZ WHICH DECIDED THE FATE OF THE
BATTLE DURING THE FEDERAL WAR MUCH MORE WONDERFUL THINGS HAD BEEN SEEN
AT THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG A CONICAL PROJECTILE THROWN BY A
RIFLEBARREL CUT UP A HUNDRED AND SEVENTYTHREE CONFEDERATES AND AT THE
PASSAGE OF THE POTOMAC A RODMAN BALL SENT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN
SOUTHERNERS INTO AN EVIDENTLY BETTER WORLD A FORMIDABLE MORTAR MUST
ALSO BE MENTIONED INVENTED BY JT MASTON A DISTINGUISHED MEMBER AND
PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE GUN CLUB THE RESULT OF WHICH WAS FAR MORE
DEADLY SEEING THAT AT ITS TRIAL SHOT IT KILLED THREE HUNDRED AND
THIRTYSEVEN PERSONSBY BURSTING IT IS TRUE

WHAT CAN BE ADDED TO THESE FIGURES SO ELOQUENT IN THEMSELVES NOTHING
SO THE FOLLOWING CALCULATION OBTAINED BY THE STATISTICIAN PITCAIRN WILL
BE ADMITTED WITHOUT CONTESTATION BY DIVIDING THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS
FALLEN UNDER THE PROJECTILES BY THAT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB HE
FOUND THAT EACH ONE OF THEM HAD KILLED ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AN AVERAGE
OF TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE MEN AND A FRACTION

BY CONSIDERING SUCH A RESULT IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE SINGLE
PREOCCUPATION OF THIS LEARNED SOCIETY WAS THE DESTRUCTION OF HUMANITY
PHILANTHROPICALLY AND THE PERFECTING OF FIREARMS CONSIDERED AS
INSTRUMENTS OF CIVILISATION IT WAS A COMPANY OF EXTERMINATING ANGELS
AT BOTTOM THE BEST FELLOWS IN THE WORLD

IT MUST BE ADDED THAT THESE YANKEES BRAVE AS THEY HAVE EVER PROVED
THEMSELVES DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO FORMULAE BUT SACRIFICED
THEMSELVES TO THEIR THEORIES AMONGST THEM MIGHT BE COUNTED OFFICERS OF
EVERY RANK THOSE WHO HAD JUST MADE THEIR DEBUT IN THE PROFESSION OF
ARMS AND THOSE WHO HAD GROWN OLD ON THEIR GUNCARRIAGE MANY WHOSE
NAMES FIGURED IN THE BOOK OF HONOUR OF THE GUN CLUB REMAINED ON THE
FIELD OF BATTLE AND OF THOSE WHO CAME BACK THE GREATER PART BORE MARKS
OF THEIR INDISPUTABLE VALOUR CRUTCHES WOODEN LEGS ARTICULATED ARMS
HANDS WITH HOOKS GUTTAPERCHA JAWS SILVER CRANIUMS PLATINUM NOSES
NOTHING WAS WANTING TO THE COLLECTION AND THE ABOVEMENTIONED PITCAIRN
LIKEWISE CALCULATED THAT IN THE GUN CLUB THERE WAS NOT QUITE ONE ARM
AMONGST EVERY FOUR PERSONS AND ONLY TWO LEGS AMONGST SIX

BUT THESE VALIANT ARTILLERYMEN PAID LITTLE HEED TO SUCH SMALL MATTERS
AND FELT JUSTLY PROUD WHEN THE REPORT OF A BATTLE STATED THE NUMBER OF
VICTIMS AT TENFOLD THE QUANTITY OF PROJECTILES EXPENDED

ONE DAY HOWEVER A SAD AND LAMENTABLE DAY PEACE WAS SIGNED BY THE
SURVIVORS OF THE WAR THE NOISE OF FIRING GRADUALLY CEASED THE MORTARS
WERE SILENT THE HOWITZERS WERE MUZZLED FOR LONG ENOUGH AND THE CANNON
WITH MUZZLES DEPRESSED WERE STORED IN THE ARSENALS THE SHOTS WERE
PILED UP IN THE PARKS THE BLOODY REMINISCENCES WERE EFFACED COTTON
SHRUBS GREW MAGNIFICENTLY ON THE WELLMANURED FIELDS MOURNING GARMENTS
BEGAN TO BE WORNOUT AS WELL AS SORROW AND THE GUN CLUB HAD NOTHING
WHATEVER TO DO

CERTAIN OLD HANDS INVETERATE WORKERS STILL WENT ON WITH THEIR
CALCULATIONS IN BALLISTICS THEY STILL IMAGINED GIGANTIC BOMBS AND
UNPARALLELED HOWITZERS BUT WHAT WAS THE USE OF VAIN THEORIES THAT COULD
NOT BE PUT IN PRACTICE SO THE SALOONS WERE DESERTED THE SERVANTS SLEPT
IN THE ANTECHAMBERS THE NEWSPAPERS GREW MOULDY ON THE TABLES FROM DARK
CORNERS ISSUED SAD SNORES AND THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB FORMERLY SO
NOISY NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY THE DISASTROUS PEACE SLEPT THE SLEEP
OF PLATONIC ARTILLERY

THIS IS DISTRESSING SAID BRAVE TOM HUNTER WHILST HIS WOODEN LEGS
WERE CARBONISING AT THE FIREPLACE OF THE SMOKINGROOM NOTHING TO DO
NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT A TIRESOME EXISTENCE WHERE IS THE TIME
WHEN CANNON AWOKE YOU EVERY MORNING WITH ITS JOYFUL REPORTS

THAT TIME IS OVER ANSWERED DANDY BILSBY TRYING TO STRETCH THE ARMS
HE HAD LOST THERE WAS SOME FUN THEN YOU INVENTED AN HOWITZER AND IT
WAS HARDLY CAST BEFORE YOU RAN TO TRY IT ON THE ENEMY THEN YOU WENT
BACK TO THE CAMP WITH AN ENCOURAGEMENT FROM SHERMAN OR A SHAKE OF THE
HANDS FROM MACCLELLAN BUT NOW THE GENERALS HAVE GONE BACK TO THEIR
COUNTERS AND INSTEAD OF CANNONBALLS THEY EXPEDITE INOFFENSIVE COTTON
BALES AH BY SAINT BARB THE FUTURE OF ARTILLERY IS LOST TO AMERICA

YES BILSBY CRIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY IT IS TOO BAD ONE FINE
MORNING YOU LEAVE YOUR TRANQUIL OCCUPATIONS YOU ARE DRILLED IN THE USE
OF ARMS YOU LEAVE BALTIMORE FOR THE BATTLEFIELD YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF
LIKE A HERO AND IN TWO YEARS THREE YEARS AT THE LATEST YOU ARE
OBLIGED TO LEAVE THE FRUIT OF SO MANY FATIGUES TO GO TO SLEEP IN
DEPLORABLE IDLENESS AND KEEP YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS

THE VALIANT COLONEL WOULD HAVE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GIVE SUCH A
PROOF OF HIS WANT OF OCCUPATION THOUGH IT WAS NOT THE POCKETS THAT WERE
WANTING

AND NO WAR IN PROSPECT THEN SAID THE FAMOUS JT MASTON SCRATCHING
HIS GUTTAPERCHA CRANIUM WITH HIS STEEL HOOK THERE IS NOT A CLOUD ON
THE HORIZON NOW THAT THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO IN THE SCIENCE OF ARTILLERY
I MYSELF FINISHED THIS VERY MORNING A DIAGRAM WITH PLAN BASIN AND
ELEVATION OF A MORTAR DESTINED TO CHANGE THE LAWS OF WARFARE

INDEED REPLIED TOM HUNTER THINKING INVOLUNTARILY OF THE HONOURABLE
JT MASTONS LAST ESSAY

INDEED ANSWERED MASTON BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF THE GOOD RESULTS OF
SUCH STUDIES AND SO MANY DIFFICULTIES CONQUERED IT IS MERE WASTE OF
TIME THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW WORLD SEEM DETERMINED TO LIVE IN PEACE AND
OUR BELLICOSE TRIBUNE HAS GONE AS FAR AS TO PREDICT APPROACHING
CATASTROPHES DUE TO THE SCANDALOUS INCREASE OF POPULATION

YET MASTON SAID COLONEL BLOMSBERRY THEY ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING IN
EUROPE TO MAINTAIN THE PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITIES

WHAT OF THAT

WHY THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO OVER THERE AND IF THEY ACCEPTED
OUR SERVICES

WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF CRIED BILSBY WORK AT BALLISTICS FOR THE
BENEFIT OF FOREIGNERS

PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOT DOING IT AT ALL ANSWERED THE
COLONEL

DOUBTLESS SAID JT MASTON IT WOULD BE BETTER BUT SUCH AN
EXPEDIENT CANNOT BE THOUGHT OF

WHY SO ASKED THE COLONEL

BECAUSE THEIR IDEAS OF ADVANCEMENT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO ALL OUR
AMERICAN CUSTOMS THOSE FOLKS SEEM TO THINK THAT YOU CANNOT BE A
GENERALINCHIEF WITHOUT HAVING SERVED AS SECOND LIEUTENANT WHICH COMES
TO THE SAME AS SAYING THAT NO ONE CAN POINT A GUN THAT HAS NOT CAST ONE
NOW THAT IS SIMPLY

ABSURD REPLIED TOM HUNTER WHITTLING THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR WITH HIS
BOWIEKNIFE AND AS THINGS ARE SO THERE IS NOTHING LEFT FOR US BUT TO
PLANT TOBACCO OR DISTIL WHALEOIL

WHAT SHOUTED JT MASTON SHALL WE NOT EMPLOY THESE LAST YEARS OF
OUR EXISTENCE IN PERFECTING FIREARMS WILL NOT A FRESH OPPORTUNITY
PRESENT ITSELF TO TRY THE RANGES OF OUR PROJECTILES WILL THE ATMOSPHERE
BE NO LONGER ILLUMINATED BY THE LIGHTNING OF OUR CANNONS WONT SOME
INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTY CROP UP THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DECLARE WAR
AGAINST SOME TRANSATLANTIC POWER WONT FRANCE RUN DOWN ONE OF OUR
STEAMERS OR WONT ENGLAND IN DEFIANCE OF THE RIGHTS OF NATIONS HANG
UP THREE OR FOUR OF OUR COUNTRYMEN

NO MASTON ANSWERED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY NO SUCH LUCK NO NOT ONE OF
THOSE INCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN AND IF ONE DID IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO
US AMERICAN SENSITIVENESS IS DECLINING DAILY AND WE ARE GOING TO THE
DOGS

YES WE ARE GROWING QUITE HUMBLE REPLIED BILSBY

AND WE ARE HUMILIATED ANSWERED TOM HUNTER

ALL THAT IS ONLY TOO TRUE REPLIED JT MASTON WITH FRESH VEHEMENCE
THERE ARE A THOUSAND REASONS FOR FIGHTING FLOATING ABOUT AND STILL WE
DONT FIGHT WE ECONOMISE LEGS AND ARMS AND THAT TO THE PROFIT OF FOLKS
THAT DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM LOOK HERE WITHOUT LOOKING ANY
FARTHER FOR A MOTIVE FOR WAR DID NOT NORTH AMERICA FORMERLY BELONG TO
THE ENGLISH

DOUBTLESS ANSWERED TOM HUNTER ANGRILY POKING THE FIRE WITH THE END
OF HIS CRUTCH

WELL REPLIED JT MASTON WHY SHOULD NOT ENGLAND IN ITS TURN BELONG
TO THE AMERICANS

IT WOULD BE BUT JUSTICE ANSWERED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY

GO AND PROPOSE THAT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CRIED JT
MASTON AND SEE WHAT SORT OF A RECEPTION YOU WOULD GET

IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD RECEPTION MURMURED BILSBY BETWEEN THE FOUR
TEETH HE HAD SAVED FROM BATTLE

IFAITH CRIED JT MASTON THEY NEED NOT COUNT UPON MY VOTE IN THE
NEXT ELECTIONS

NOR UPON OURS ANSWERED WITH COMMON ACCORD THESE BELLICOSE INVALIDS

IN THE MEANTIME CONTINUED JT MASTON AND TO CONCLUDE IF THEY DO
NOT FURNISH ME WITH THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING MY NEW MORTAR ON A REAL
BATTLEFIELD I SHALL SEND IN MY RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF THE GUN CLUB
AND I SHALL GO AND BURY MYSELF IN THE BACKWOODS OF ARKANSAS

WE WILL FOLLOW YOU THERE ANSWERED THE INTERLOCUTORS OF THE
ENTERPRISING JT MASTON

THINGS HAD COME TO THAT PASS AND THE CLUB GETTING MORE EXCITED WAS
MENACED WITH APPROACHING DISSOLUTION WHEN AN UNEXPECTED EVENT CAME TO
PREVENT SO REGRETTABLE A CATASTROPHE

THE VERY DAY AFTER THE FOREGOING CONVERSATION EACH MEMBER OF THE CLUB
RECEIVED A CIRCULAR COUCHED IN THESE TERMS

BALTIMORE OCTOBER RD

THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAS THE HONOUR TO INFORM HIS COLLEAGUES
THAT AT THE MEETING ON THE TH ULTIMO HE WILL MAKE THEM A COMMUNICATION
OF AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING NATURE HE THEREFORE BEGS THAT THEY TO THE
SUSPENSION OF ALL OTHER BUSINESS WILL ATTEND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PRESENT INVITATION

THEIR DEVOTED COLLEAGUE

CHAPTER II

PRESIDENT BARBICANES COMMUNICATION


ON THE TH OF OCTOBER AT  PM A DENSE CROWD PRESSED INTO THE SALOONS
OF THE GUN CLUB  UNIONSQUARE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CLUB RESIDING
AT BALTIMORE HAD GONE ON THE INVITATION OF THEIR PRESIDENT THE EXPRESS
BROUGHT CORRESPONDING MEMBERS BY HUNDREDS AND IF THE MEETINGHALL HAD
NOT BEEN SO LARGE THE CROWD OF SAVANTS COULD NOT HAVE FOUND ROOM IN
IT THEY OVERFLOWED INTO THE NEIGHBOURING ROOMS DOWN THE PASSAGES AND
EVEN INTO THE COURTYARDS THERE THEY RAN AGAINST THE POPULACE WHO WERE
PRESSING AGAINST THE DOORS EACH TRYING TO GET INTO THE FRONT RANK ALL
EAGER TO LEARN THE IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION OF PRESIDENT BARBICANE ALL
PRESSING SQUEEZING CRUSHING WITH THAT LIBERTY OF ACTION PECULIAR TO
THE MASSES BROUGHT UP IN THE IDEA OF SELFGOVERNMENT

THAT EVENING ANY STRANGER WHO MIGHT HAVE CHANCED TO BE IN BALTIMORE
COULD NOT HAVE OBTAINED A PLACE AT ANY PRICE IN THE LARGE HALL IT WAS
EXCLUSIVELY RESERVED TO RESIDING OR CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NO ONE ELSE
WAS ADMITTED AND THE CITY MAGNATES COMMON COUNCILLORS AND SELECT MEN
WERE COMPELLED TO MINGLE WITH THEIR INFERIORS IN ORDER TO CATCH STRAY
NEWS FROM THE INTERIOR

THE IMMENSE HALL PRESENTED A CURIOUS SPECTACLE IT WAS MARVELLOUSLY
ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS BUILT LOFTY PILLARS FORMED OF
CANNON SUPERPOSED UPON HUGE MORTARS AS A BASE SUPPORTED THE FINE
IRONWORK OF THE ARCHESREAL CASTIRON LACEWORK

TROPHIES OF BLUNDERBUSSES MATCHLOCKS ARQUEBUSES CARBINES ALL SORTS
OF ANCIENT OR MODERN FIREARMS WERE PICTURESQUELY ENLACED AGAINST THE
WALLS THE GAS IN FULL FLAME CAME OUT OF A THOUSAND REVOLVERS GROUPED
IN THE FORM OF LUSTRES WHILST CANDLESTICKS OF PISTOLS AND CANDELABRA
MADE OF GUNS DONE UP IN SHEAVES COMPLETED THIS DISPLAY OF LIGHT MODELS
OF CANNONS SPECIMENS OF BRONZE TARGETS SPOTTED WITH SHOTMARKS
PLAQUES BROKEN BY THE SHOCK OF THE GUN CLUB BALLS ASSORTMENTS OF
RAMMERS AND SPONGES CHAPLETS OF SHELLS NECKLACES OF PROJECTILES
GARLANDS OF HOWITZERSIN A WORD ALL THE TOOLS OF THE ARTILLERYMAN
SURPRISED THE EYES BY THEIR WONDERFUL ARRANGEMENT AND INDUCED A BELIEF
THAT THEIR REAL PURPOSE WAS MORE ORNAMENTAL THAN DEADLY

IN THE PLACE OF HONOUR WAS SEEN COVERED BY A SPLENDID GLASS CASE A
PIECE OF BREECH BROKEN AND TWISTED UNDER THE EFFORT OF THE POWDERA
PRECIOUS FRAGMENT OF JT MASTONS CANNON

AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HALL THE PRESIDENT ASSISTED BY FOUR
SECRETARIES OCCUPIED A WIDE PLATFORM HIS CHAIR PLACED ON A CARVED
GUNCARRIAGE WAS MODELLED UPON THE POWERFUL PROPORTIONS OF A INCH
MORTAR IT WAS POINTED AT AN ANGLE OF  DEGS AND HUNG UPON TRUNNIONS
SO THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD USE IT AS A ROCKINGCHAIR VERY AGREEABLE IN
GREAT HEAT UPON THE DESK A HUGE IRON PLATE SUPPORTED UPON SIX
CARRONADES STOOD A VERY TASTEFUL INKSTAND MADE OF A BEAUTIFULLYCHASED
SPANISH PIECE AND A REPORTBELL WHICH WHEN REQUIRED WENT OFF LIKE A
REVOLVER DURING THE VEHEMENT DISCUSSIONS THIS NEW SORT OF BELL SCARCELY
SUFFICED TO COVER THE VOICES OF THIS LEGION OF EXCITED ARTILLERYMEN

IN FRONT OF THE DESK BENCHES ARRANGED IN ZIGZAGS LIKE THE
CIRCUMVALLATIONS OF INTRENCHMENT FORMED A SUCCESSION OF BASTIONS AND
CURTAINS WHERE THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB TOOK THEIR SEATS AND THAT
EVENING IT MAY BE SAID THERE WERE PLENTY ON THE RAMPARTS THE
PRESIDENT WAS SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN FOR ALL TO BE ASSURED THAT HE WOULD NOT
HAVE CALLED TOGETHER HIS COLLEAGUES WITHOUT A VERY GREAT MOTIVE

IMPEY BARBICANE WAS A MAN OF FORTY CALM COLD AUSTERE OF A SINGULARLY
SERIOUS AND CONCENTRATED MIND AS EXACT AS A CHRONOMETER OF AN
IMPERTURBABLE TEMPERAMENT AND IMMOVABLE CHARACTER NOT VERY CHIVALROUS
YET ADVENTUROUS AND ALWAYS BRINGING PRACTICAL IDEAS TO BEAR ON THE
WILDEST ENTERPRISES AN ESSENTIAL NEWENGLANDER A NORTHERN COLONIST
THE DESCENDANT OF THOSE ROUNDHEADS SO FATAL TO THE STUARTS AND THE
IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF THE SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN THE ANCIENT CAVALIERS OF THE
MOTHER COUNTRYIN A WORD A YANKEE CAST IN A SINGLE MOULD

BARBICANE HAD MADE A GREAT FORTUNE AS A TIMBERMERCHANT NAMED DIRECTOR
OF ARTILLERY DURING THE WAR HE SHOWED HIMSELF FERTILE IN INVENTIONS
ENTERPRISING IN HIS IDEAS HE CONTRIBUTED POWERFULLY TO THE PROGRESS OF
BALLISTICS GAVE AN IMMENSE IMPETUS TO EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES

HE WAS A PERSON OF AVERAGE HEIGHT HAVING BY A RARE EXCEPTION IN THE
GUN CLUB ALL HIS LIMBS INTACT HIS STRONGLYMARKED FEATURES SEEMED TO
BE DRAWN BY SQUARE AND RULE AND IF IT BE TRUE THAT IN ORDER TO GUESS
THE INSTINCTS OF A MAN ONE MUST LOOK AT HIS PROFILE BARBICANE SEEN
THUS OFFERED THE MOST CERTAIN INDICATIONS OF ENERGY AUDACITY AND
SANGFROID

AT THAT MOMENT HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN HIS CHAIR MUTE ABSORBED WITH
AN INWARD LOOK SHELTERED UNDER HIS TALL HAT A CYLINDER OF BLACK SILK
WHICH SEEMS SCREWED DOWN UPON THE SKULL OF AMERICAN MEN

HIS COLLEAGUES TALKED NOISILY AROUND HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM THEY
QUESTIONED ONE ANOTHER LAUNCHED INTO THE FIELD OF SUPPOSITIONS
EXAMINED THEIR PRESIDENT AND TRIED BUT IN VAIN TO MAKE OUT THE X OF
HIS IMPERTURBABLE PHYSIOGNOMY

JUST AS EIGHT OCLOCK STRUCK FROM THE FULMINATING CLOCK OF THE LARGE
HALL BARBICANE AS IF MOVED BY A SPRING JUMPED UP A GENERAL SILENCE
ENSUED AND THE ORATOR IN A SLIGHTLY EMPHATIC TONE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS

BRAVE COLLEAGUESIT IS SOME TIME SINCE AN UNFRUITFUL PEACE PLUNGED
THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB INTO DEPLORABLE INACTIVITY AFTER A PERIOD
OF SOME YEARS SO FULL OF INCIDENTS WE HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO ABANDON OUR
WORKS AND STOP SHORT ON THE ROAD OF PROGRESS I DO NOT FEAR TO PROCLAIM
ALOUD THAT ANY WAR WHICH WOULD PUT ARMS IN OUR HANDS AGAIN WOULD BE
WELCOME

YES WAR CRIED IMPETUOUS JT MASTON

HEAR HEAR WAS HEARD ON EVERY SIDE

BUT WAR SAID BARBICANE WAR IS IMPOSSIBLE UNDER ACTUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHATEVER MY HONOURABLE INTERRUPTER MAY HOPE LONG
YEARS WILL ELAPSE BEFORE OUR CANNONS THUNDER ON A FIELD OF BATTLE WE
MUST THEREFORE MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO IT AND SEEK IN ANOTHER ORDER OF
IDEAS FOOD FOR THE ACTIVITY BY WHICH WE ARE DEVOURED

THE ASSEMBLY FELT THAT ITS PRESIDENT WAS COMING TO THE DELICATE POINT
IT REDOUBLED ITS ATTENTION

A FEW MONTHS AGO MY BRAVE COLLEAGUES CONTINUED BARBICANE I ASKED
MYSELF IF WHILST STILL REMAINING IN OUR SPECIALITY WE COULD NOT
UNDERTAKE SOME GRAND EXPERIMENT WORTHY OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND IF
THE PROGRESS OF BALLISTICS WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO EXECUTE IT WITH
SUCCESS I HAVE THEREFORE SOUGHT WORKED CALCULATED AND THE CONVICTION
HAS RESULTED FROM MY STUDIES THAT WE MUST SUCCEED IN AN ENTERPRISE THAT
WOULD SEEM IMPRACTICABLE IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY THIS PROJECT ELABORATED
AT LENGTH WILL FORM THE SUBJECT OF MY COMMUNICATION IT IS WORTHY OF
YOU WORTHY OF THE GUN CLUBS PAST HISTORY AND CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE A
NOISE IN THE WORLD

MUCH NOISE CRIED A PASSIONATE ARTILLERYMAN

MUCH NOISE IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD ANSWERED BARBICANE

DONT INTERRUPT REPEATED SEVERAL VOICES

I THEREFORE BEG OF YOU MY BRAVE COLLEAGUES RESUMED THE PRESIDENT
TO GRANT ME ALL YOUR ATTENTION

A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY BARBICANE HAVING WITH A RAPID
GESTURE FIRMLY FIXED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD CONTINUED HIS SPEECH IN A CALM
TONE

THERE IS NOT ONE OF YOU BRAVE COLLEAGUES WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE MOON
OR AT LEAST HEARD OF IT DO NOT BE ASTONISHED IF I WISH TO SPEAK TO
YOU ABOUT THE QUEEN OF NIGHT IT IS PERHAPS OUR LOT TO BE THE
COLUMBUSES OF THIS UNKNOWN WORLD UNDERSTAND ME AND SECOND ME AS MUCH
AS YOU CAN I WILL LEAD YOU TO ITS CONQUEST AND ITS NAME SHALL BE
JOINED TO THOSE OF THE THIRTYSIX STATES THAT FORM THE GRAND COUNTRY OF
THE UNION

HURRAH FOR THE MOON CRIED THE GUN CLUB WITH ONE VOICE

THE MOON HAS BEEN MUCH STUDIED RESUMED BARBICANE ITS MASS DENSITY
WEIGHT VOLUME CONSTITUTION MOVEMENTS DISTANCE THE PART IT PLAYS IN
THE SOLAR WORLD ARE ALL PERFECTLY DETERMINED SELENOGRAPHIC MAPS HAVE
BEEN DRAWN WITH A PERFECTION THAT EQUALS IF IT DOES NOT SURPASS THOSE
OF TERRESTRIAL MAPS PHOTOGRAPHY HAS GIVEN TO OUR SATELLITE PROOFS OF
INCOMPARABLE BEAUTYIN A WORD ALL THAT THE SCIENCES OF MATHEMATICS
ASTRONOMY GEOLOGY AND OPTICS CAN TEACH IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MOON BUT
UNTIL NOW NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH IT HAS EVER BEEN ESTABLISHED

A VIOLENT MOVEMENT OF INTEREST AND SURPRISE WELCOMED THIS SENTENCE OF
THE ORATOR

ALLOW ME HE RESUMED TO RECALL TO YOU IN FEW WORDS HOW CERTAIN
ARDENT MINDS EMBARKED UPON IMAGINARY JOURNEYS PRETENDED TO HAVE
PENETRATED THE SECRETS OF OUR SATELLITE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY A
CERTAIN DAVID FABRICIUS BOASTED OF HAVING SEEN THE INHABITANTS OF THE
MOON WITH HIS OWN EYES IN  A FRENCHMAN JEAN BAUDOIN PUBLISHED HIS
JOURNEY TO THE MOON BY DOMINIQUE GONZALES SPANISH ADVENTURER AT THE
SAME EPOCH CYRANO DE BERGERAC PUBLISHED THE CELEBRATED EXPEDITION THAT
HAD SO MUCH SUCCESS IN FRANCE LATER ON ANOTHER FRENCHMAN THAT NATION
TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF NOTICE OF THE MOON NAMED FONTENELLE WROTE HIS
PLURALITY OF WORLDS A MASTERPIECE OF HIS TIME BUT SCIENCE IN ITS
PROGRESS CRUSHES EVEN MASTERPIECES ABOUT  A PAMPHLET TRANSLATED
FROM THE NEW YORK AMERICAN RELATED THAT SIR JOHN HERSCHEL SENT TO
THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THERE TO MAKE ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS HAD BY
MEANS OF A TELESCOPE PERFECTED BY INTERIOR LIGHTING BROUGHT THE MOON
TO WITHIN A DISTANCE OF EIGHTY YARDS THEN HE DISTINCTLY PERCEIVED
CAVERNS IN WHICH LIVED HIPPOPOTAMI GREEN MOUNTAINS WITH GOLDEN BORDERS
SHEEP WITH IVORY HORNS WHITE DEER AND INHABITANTS WITH MEMBRANEOUS
WINGS LIKE THOSE OF BATS THIS TREATISE THE WORK OF AN AMERICAN NAMED
LOCKE HAD A VERY GREAT SUCCESS BUT IT WAS SOON FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS A
SCIENTIFIC MYSTIFICATION AND FRENCHMEN WERE THE FIRST TO LAUGH AT IT

LAUGH AT AN AMERICAN CRIED JT MASTON BUT THATS A CASUS BELLI

BE COMFORTED MY WORTHY FRIEND BEFORE FRENCHMEN LAUGHED THEY WERE
COMPLETELY TAKEN IN BY OUR COUNTRYMAN TO TERMINATE THIS RAPID HISTORY
I MAY ADD THAT A CERTAIN HANS PFAAL OF ROTTERDAM WENT UP IN A BALLOON
FILLED WITH A GAS MADE FROM AZOTE THIRTYSEVEN TIMES LIGHTER THAN
HYDROGEN AND REACHED THE MOON AFTER A JOURNEY OF NINETEEN DAYS THIS
JOURNEY LIKE THE PRECEDING ATTEMPTS WAS PURELY IMAGINARY BUT IT WAS
THE WORK OF A POPULAR AMERICAN WRITER OF A STRANGE AND CONTEMPLATIVE
GENIUS I HAVE NAMED EDGAR POE

HURRAH FOR EDGAR POE CRIED THE ASSEMBLY ELECTRIFIED BY THE WORDS OF
THE PRESIDENT

I HAVE NOW COME TO AN END OF THESE ATTEMPTS WHICH I MAY CALL PURELY
LITERARY AND QUITE INSUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH ANY SERIOUS COMMUNICATIONS
WITH THE QUEEN OF NIGHT HOWEVER I OUGHT TO ADD THAT SOME PRACTICAL
MINDS TRIED TO PUT THEMSELVES INTO SERIOUS COMMUNICATION WITH HER SOME
YEARS AGO A GERMAN MATHEMATICIAN PROPOSED TO SEND A COMMISSION OF
SAVANTS TO THE STEPPES OF SIBERIA THERE ON THE VAST PLAINS IMMENSE
GEOMETRICAL FIGURES WERE TO BE TRACED BY MEANS OF LUMINOUS REFLECTORS
AMONGST OTHERS THE SQUARE OF THE HYPOTHENUSE VULGARLY CALLED THE
ASSS BRIDGE ANY INTELLIGENT BEING SAID THE MATHEMATICIAN OUGHT
TO UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC DESTINATION OF THAT FIGURE THE SELENITES
INHABITANTS OF THE MOON IF THEY EXIST WILL ANSWER BY A SIMILAR
FIGURE AND COMMUNICATION ONCE ESTABLISHED IT WILL BE EASY TO CREATE
AN ALPHABET THAT WILL ALLOW US TO HOLD CONVERSE WITH THE INHABITANTS OF
THE MOON THUS SPOKE THE GERMAN MATHEMATICIAN BUT HIS PROJECT WAS NOT
PUT INTO EXECUTION AND UNTIL NOW NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION HAS EXISTED
BETWEEN THE EARTH AND HER SATELLITE BUT IT WAS RESERVED TO THE
PRACTICAL GENIUS OF AMERICANS TO PUT ITSELF INTO COMMUNICATION WITH THE
SIDEREAL WORLD THE MEANS OF DOING SO ARE SIMPLE EASY CERTAIN
UNFAILING AND WILL MAKE THE SUBJECT OF MY PROPOSITION

A HUBBUB AND TEMPEST OF EXCLAMATIONS WELCOMED THESE WORDS THERE WAS NOT
ONE OF THE AUDIENCE WHO WAS NOT DOMINATED AND CARRIED AWAY BY THE WORDS
OF THE ORATOR

HEAR HEAR SILENCE WAS HEARD ON ALL SIDES

WHEN THE AGITATION WAS CALMED DOWN BARBICANE RESUMED IN A GRAVER TONE
HIS INTERRUPTED SPEECH

YOU KNOW SAID HE WHAT PROGRESS THE SCIENCE OF BALLISTICS HAS MADE
DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AND TO WHAT DEGREE OF PERFECTION FIREARMS
WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IF THE WAR HAD GONE ON YOU ARE NOT IGNORANT IN
GENERAL THAT THE POWER OF RESISTANCE OF CANNONS AND THE EXPANSIVE FORCE
OF POWDER ARE UNLIMITED WELL STARTING FROM THAT PRINCIPLE I ASKED
MYSELF IF BY MEANS OF SUFFICIENT APPARATUS ESTABLISHED UNDER
DETERMINED CONDITIONS OF RESISTANCE IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SEND A
CANNONBALL TO THE MOON

AT THESE WORDS AN OH OF STUPEFACTION ESCAPED FROM A THOUSAND PANTING
BREASTS THEN OCCURRED A MOMENT OF SILENCE LIKE THE PROFOUND CALM THAT
PRECEDES THUNDER IN FACT THE THUNDER CAME BUT A THUNDER OF APPLAUSE
CRIES AND CLAMOUR WHICH MADE THE MEETINGHALL SHAKE AGAIN THE
PRESIDENT TRIED TO SPEAK HE COULD NOT IT WAS ONLY AT THE END OF TEN
MINUTES THAT HE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HIMSELF HEARD

LET ME FINISH HE RESUMED COLDLY I HAVE LOOKED AT THE QUESTION IN
ALL ITS ASPECTS AND FROM MY INDISPUTABLE CALCULATIONS IT RESULTS THAT
ANY PROJECTILE HURLED AT AN INITIAL SPEED OF TWELVE THOUSAND YARDS A
SECOND AND DIRECTED AT THE MOON MUST NECESSARILY REACH HER I HAVE
THEREFORE THE HONOUR OF PROPOSING TO YOU MY WORTHY COLLEAGUES THE
ATTEMPTING OF THIS LITTLE EXPERIMENT




CHAPTER III

EFFECT OF PRESIDENT BARBICANES COMMUNICATION


IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEPICT THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE LAST WORDS OF THE
HONOURABLE PRESIDENT WHAT CRIES WHAT VOCIFERATIONS WHAT A SUCCESSION
OF GROANS HURRAHS CHEERS AND ALL THE ONOMATOPOEIA OF WHICH THE
AMERICAN LANGUAGE IS SO FULL IT WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE HUBBUB AND
DISORDER MOUTHS HANDS AND FEET MADE AS MUCH NOISE AS THEY COULD ALL
THE WEAPONS IN THIS ARTILLERY MUSEUM GOING OFF AT ONCE WOULD NOT HAVE
MORE VIOLENTLY AGITATED THE WAVES OF SOUND THAT IS NOT SURPRISING
THERE ARE CANNONEERS NEARLY AS NOISY AS THEIR CANNONS

BARBICANE REMAINED CALM AMIDST THESE ENTHUSIASTIC CLAMOURS PERHAPS HE
AGAIN WISHED TO ADDRESS SOME WORDS TO HIS COLLEAGUES FOR HIS GESTURES
ASKED FOR SILENCE AND HIS FULMINATING BELL EXHAUSTED ITSELF IN VIOLENT
DETONATIONS IT WAS NOT EVEN HEARD HE WAS SOON DRAGGED FROM HIS CHAIR
CARRIED IN TRIUMPH AND FROM THE HANDS OF HIS FAITHFUL COMRADES HE
PASSED INTO THOSE OF THE NO LESS EXCITED CROWD

NOTHING CAN ASTONISH AN AMERICAN IT HAS OFTEN BEEN REPEATED THAT THE
WORD IMPOSSIBLE IS NOT FRENCH THE WRONG DICTIONARY MUST HAVE BEEN
TAKEN BY MISTAKE IN AMERICA EVERYTHING IS EASY EVERYTHING IS SIMPLE
AND AS TO MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES THEY ARE DEAD BEFORE THEY ARE BORN
BETWEEN THE BARBICANE PROJECT AND ITS REALISATION NOT ONE TRUE YANKEE
WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO SEE EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF A DIFFICULTY
AS SOON SAID AS DONE

THE TRIUMPHANT MARCH OF THE PRESIDENT WAS PROLONGED DURING THE EVENING
A VERITABLE TORCHLIGHT PROCESSIONIRISH GERMANS FRENCHMEN
SCOTCHMENALL THE HETEROGENEOUS INDIVIDUALS THAT COMPOSE THE POPULATION
OF MARYLANDSHOUTED IN THEIR MATERNAL TONGUE AND THE CHEERING WAS
UNANIMOUS

PRECISELY AS IF SHE KNEW IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER THE MOON SHONE OUT THEN
WITH SERENE MAGNIFICENCE ECLIPSING OTHER LIGHTS WITH HER INTENSE
IRRADIATION ALL THE YANKEES DIRECTED THEIR EYES TOWARDS THE SHINING
DISC SOME SALUTED HER WITH THEIR HANDS OTHERS CALLED HER BY THE
SWEETEST NAMES BETWEEN EIGHT OCLOCK AND MIDNIGHT AN OPTICIAN IN
JONESFALLSTREET MADE A FORTUNE BY SELLING FIELDGLASSES THE QUEEN OF
NIGHT WAS LOOKED AT THROUGH THEM LIKE A LADY OF HIGH LIFE THE AMERICANS
ACTED IN REGARD TO HER WITH THE FREEDOM OF PROPRIETORS IT SEEMED AS IF
THE BLONDE PHOEBE BELONGED TO THESE ENTERPRISING CONQUERORS AND ALREADY
FORMED PART OF THE UNION TERRITORY AND YET THE ONLY QUESTION WAS THAT
OF SENDING A PROJECTILEA RATHER BRUTAL WAY OF ENTERING INTO
COMMUNICATION EVEN WITH A SATELLITE BUT MUCH IN VOGUE AMONGST CIVILISED
NATIONS

MIDNIGHT HAD JUST STRUCK AND THE ENTHUSIASM DID NOT DIMINISH IT WAS
KEPT UP IN EQUAL DOSES IN ALL CLASSES OF THE POPULATION MAGISTRATES
SAVANTS MERCHANTS TRADESMEN STREETPORTERS INTELLIGENT AS WELL AS
GREEN MEN WERE MOVED EVEN IN THEIR MOST DELICATE FIBRES IT WAS A
NATIONAL ENTERPRISE THE HIGH TOWN LOW TOWN THE QUAYS BATHED BY THE
WATERS OF THE PATAPSCO THE SHIPS IMPRISONED IN THEIR DOCKS OVERFLOWED
WITH CROWDS INTOXICATED WITH JOY GIN AND WHISKY EVERYBODY TALKED
ARGUED PERORATED DISPUTED APPROVED AND APPLAUDED FROM THE GENTLEMAN
COMFORTABLY STRETCHED ON THE BARROOM COUCH BEFORE HIS GLASS OF
SHERRYCOBBLER TO THE WATERMAN WHO GOT DRUNK UPON KNOCKMEDOWN IN
THE DARK TAVERNS OF FELLS POINT

HOWEVER ABOUT  AM THE EMOTION BECAME CALMER PRESIDENT BARBICANE
SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HOME ALMOST KNOCKED TO PIECES A HERCULES COULD NOT
HAVE RESISTED SUCH ENTHUSIASM THE CROWD GRADUALLY ABANDONED THE SQUARES
AND STREETS THE FOUR RAILROADS OF OHIO SUSQUEHANNA PHILADELPHIA AND
WASHINGTON WHICH CONVERGE AT BALTIMORE TOOK THE HETEROGENEOUS
POPULATION TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE TOWN
REPOSED IN A RELATIVE TRANQUILLITY

IT WOULD BE AN ERROR TO BELIEVE THAT DURING THIS MEMORABLE EVENING
BALTIMORE ALONE WAS AGITATED THE LARGE TOWNS OF THE UNION NEW YORK
BOSTON ALBANY WASHINGTON RICHMOND NEW ORLEANS CHARLESTOWN LA
MOBILE OF TEXAS MASSACHUSETTS MICHIGAN AND FLORIDA ALL SHARED IN THE
DELIRIUM THE THIRTY THOUSAND CORRESPONDENTS OF THE GUN CLUB WERE
ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR PRESIDENTS LETTER AND AWAITED WITH EQUAL
IMPATIENCE THE FAMOUS COMMUNICATION OF THE TH OF OCTOBER THE SAME
EVENING AS THE ORATOR UTTERED HIS SPEECH IT RAN ALONG THE TELEGRAPH
WIRES ACROSS THE STATES OF THE UNION WITH A SPEED OF  MILES A
SECOND IT MAY THEREFORE BE SAID WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT AT THE
SAME MOMENT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TEN TIMES AS LARGE AS FRANCE
CHEERED WITH A SINGLE VOICE AND TWENTYFIVE MILLIONS OF HEARTS SWOLLEN
WITH PRIDE BEAT WITH THE SAME PULSATION

THE NEXT DAY FIVE HUNDRED DAILY WEEKLY MONTHLY OR BIMONTHLY
NEWSPAPERS TOOK UP THE QUESTION THEY EXAMINED IT UNDER ITS DIFFERENT
ASPECTSPHYSICAL METEOROLOGICAL ECONOMICAL OR MORAL FROM A
POLITICAL OR SOCIAL POINT OF VIEW THEY DEBATED WHETHER THE MOON WAS A
FINISHED WORLD OR IF SHE WAS NOT STILL UNDERGOING TRANSFORMATION DID
SHE RESEMBLE THE EARTH IN THE TIME WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE DID NOT YET
EXIST WHAT KIND OF SPECTACLE WOULD HER HIDDEN HEMISPHERE PRESENT TO OUR
TERRESTRIAL SPHEROID GRANTING THAT THE QUESTION AT PRESENT WAS SIMPLY
ABOUT SENDING A PROJECTILE TO THE QUEEN OF NIGHT EVERY ONE SAW IN THAT
THE STARTINGPOINT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ALL HOPED THAT ONE DAY
AMERICA WOULD PENETRATE THE LAST SECRETS OF THE MYSTERIOUS ORB AND SOME
EVEN SEEMED TO FEAR THAT HER CONQUEST WOULD DISTURB THE BALANCE OF POWER
IN EUROPE

THE PROJECT ONCE UNDER DISCUSSION NOT ONE OF THE PAPERS SUGGESTED A
DOUBT OF ITS REALISATION ALL THE PAPERS TREATISES BULLETINS AND
MAGAZINES PUBLISHED BY SCIENTIFIC LITERARY OR RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES
ENLARGED UPON ITS ADVANTAGES AND THE NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY OF
BOSTON THE SCIENCE AND ART SOCIETY OF ALBANY THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND
STATISTICAL SOCIETY OF NEW YORK THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY
OF PHILADELPHIA AND THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON SENT IN
A THOUSAND LETTERS THEIR CONGRATULATIONS TO THE GUN CLUB WITH IMMEDIATE
OFFERS OF SERVICE AND MONEY

IT MAY BE SAID THAT NO PROPOSITION EVER HAD SO MANY ADHERENTS THERE WAS
NO QUESTION OF HESITATIONS DOUBTS OR ANXIETIES AS TO THE JOKES
CARICATURES AND COMIC SONGS THAT WOULD HAVE WELCOMED IN EUROPE AND
ABOVE ALL IN FRANCE THE IDEA OF SENDING A PROJECTILE TO THE MOON THEY
WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED AGAINST THEIR AUTHOR ALL THE LIFEPRESERVERS
IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN POWERLESS TO GUARANTEE HIM AGAINST THE
GENERAL INDIGNATION THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT TO BE LAUGHED AT IN
THE NEW WORLD

IMPEY BARBICANE BECAME FROM THAT DAY ONE OF THE GREATEST CITIZENS OF THE
UNITED STATES SOMETHING LIKE A WASHINGTON OF SCIENCE AND ONE FACT
AMONGST SEVERAL WILL SERVE TO SHOW THE SUDDEN HOMAGE WHICH WAS PAID BY A
NATION TO ONE MAN

SOME DAYS AFTER THE FAMOUS MEETING OF THE GUN CLUB THE MANAGER OF AN
ENGLISH COMPANY ANNOUNCED AT THE BALTIMORE THEATRE A REPRESENTATION OF
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING BUT THE POPULATION OF THE TOWN SEEING IN THE
TITLE A DAMAGING ALLUSION TO THE PROJECTS OF PRESIDENT BARBICANE
INVADED THE THEATRE BROKE THE SEATS AND FORCED THE UNFORTUNATE MANAGER
TO CHANGE THE PLAY LIKE A SENSIBLE MAN THE MANAGER BOWING TO PUBLIC
OPINION REPLACED THE OFFENDING COMEDY BY AS YOU LIKE IT AND FOR
SEVERAL WEEKS HE HAD FABULOUS HOUSES




CHAPTER IV

ANSWER FROM THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY


IN THE MEANTIME BARBICANE DID NOT LOSE AN INSTANT AMIDST THE ENTHUSIASM
OF WHICH HE WAS THE OBJECT HIS FIRST CARE WAS TO CALL TOGETHER HIS
COLLEAGUES IN THE BOARDROOM OF THE GUN CLUB THERE AFTER A DEBATE
THEY AGREED TO CONSULT ASTRONOMERS ABOUT THE ASTRONOMICAL PART OF THEIR
ENTERPRISE THEIR ANSWER ONCE KNOWN THEY WOULD THEN DISCUSS THE
MECHANICAL MEANS AND NOTHING WOULD BE NEGLECTED TO ASSURE THE SUCCESS
OF THEIR GREAT EXPERIMENT

A NOTE IN PRECISE TERMS CONTAINING SPECIAL QUESTIONS WAS DRAWN UP AND
ADDRESSED TO THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE IN MASSACHUSETTS THIS TOWN
WHERE THE FIRST UNIVERSITY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED IS JUSTLY
CELEBRATED FOR ITS ASTRONOMICAL STAFF THERE ARE ASSEMBLED THE GREATEST
MEN OF SCIENCE THERE IS THE POWERFUL TELESCOPE WHICH ENABLED BOND TO
RESOLVE THE NEBULA OF ANDROMEDA AND CLARKE TO DISCOVER THE SATELLITE OF
SIRIUS THIS CELEBRATED INSTITUTION WAS THEREFORE WORTHY IN EVERY WAY
OF THE CONFIDENCE OF THE GUN CLUB

AFTER TWO DAYS THE ANSWER IMPATIENTLY AWAITED REACHED THE HANDS OF
PRESIDENT BARBICANE

IT RAN AS FOLLOWS

THE DIRECTOR OF THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN
CLUB AT BALTIMORE

ON THE RECEIPT OF YOUR FAVOUR OF THE TH INST ADDRESSED TO THE
OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE IN THE NAME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BALTIMORE
GUN CLUB WE IMMEDIATELY CALLED A MEETING OF OUR STAFF WHO HAVE DEEMED
IT EXPEDIENT TO ANSWER AS FOLLOWS

THE QUESTIONS PROPOSED TO IT WERE THESE

 IS IT POSSIBLE TO SEND A PROJECTILE TO THE MOON

 WHAT IS THE EXACT DISTANCE THAT SEPARATES THE EARTH AND HER
SATELLITE

 WHAT WOULD BE THE DURATION OF THE PROJECTILES TRANSIT TO WHICH A
SUFFICIENT INITIAL SPEED HAD BEEN GIVEN AND CONSEQUENTLY AT WHAT MOMENT
SHOULD IT BE HURLED SO AS TO REACH THE MOON AT A PARTICULAR POINT

 AT WHAT MOMENT WOULD THE MOON PRESENT THE MOST FAVOURABLE POSITION
FOR BEING REACHED BY THE PROJECTILE

 WHAT POINT IN THE HEAVENS OUGHT THE CANNON DESTINED TO HURL THE
PROJECTILE BE AIMED AT

 WHAT PLACE IN THE HEAVENS WILL THE MOON OCCUPY AT THE MOMENT WHEN
THE PROJECTILE WILL START

REGARDING QUESTION NO  IS IT POSSIBLE TO SEND A PROJECTILE TO THE
MOON

YES IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEND A PROJECTILE TO THE MOON IF IT IS GIVEN AN
INITIAL VELOCITY OF  YARDS A SECOND CALCULATIONS PROVE THAT THIS
SPEED IS SUFFICIENT IN PROPORTION TO THE DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH THE
FORCE OF GRAVITATION DIMINISHES IN AN INVERSE RATIO TO THE SQUARE OF THE
DISTANCETHAT IS TO SAY THAT FOR A DISTANCE THREE TIMES GREATER THAT
FORCE IS NINE TIMES LESS IN CONSEQUENCE THE WEIGHT OF THE PROJECTILE
WILL DECREASE RAPIDLY AND WILL END BY BEING COMPLETELY ANNULLED AT THE
MOMENT WHEN THE ATTRACTION OF THE MOON WILL BE EQUAL TO THAT OF THE
EARTHTHAT IS TO SAY AT THE  OF THE DISTANCE AT THAT MOMENT THE
PROJECTILE WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT AT ALL AND IF IT CLEARS THAT POINT IT
WILL FALL ON TO THE MOON ONLY BY THE EFFECT OF LUNAR GRAVITATION THE
THEORETIC POSSIBILITY OF THE EXPERIMENT IS THEREFORE QUITE
DEMONSTRATED AS TO ITS SUCCESS THAT DEPENDS SOLELY IN THE POWER OF THE
ENGINE EMPLOYED

REGARDING QUESTION NO  WHAT IS THE EXACT DISTANCE THAT SEPARATES
THE EARTH FROM HER SATELLITE

THE MOON DOES NOT DESCRIBE A CIRCLE ROUND THE EARTH BUT AN ELLIPSE OF
WHICH OUR EARTH OCCUPIES ONE OF THE FOCI THE CONSEQUENCE IS THEREFORE
THAT AT CERTAIN TIMES IT APPROACHES NEARER TO AND AT OTHERS RECEDES
FARTHER FROM THE EARTH OR IN ASTRONOMICAL LANGUAGE IT HAS ITS APOGEE
AND ITS PERIGEE AT ITS APOGEE THE MOON IS AT  MILES FROM THE
EARTH AND AT ITS PERIGEE AT  MILES ONLY WHICH MAKES A
DIFFERENCE OF  OR MORE THAN A NINTH OF THE DISTANCE THE PERIGEE
DISTANCE IS THEREFORE THE ONE THAT SHOULD GIVE US THE BASIS OF ALL
CALCULATIONS

REGARDING QUESTION NO  WHAT WOULD BE THE DURATION OF THE
PROJECTILES TRANSIT TO WHICH A SUFFICIENT INITIAL SPEED HAS BEEN GIVEN
AND CONSEQUENTLY AT WHAT MOMENT SHOULD IT BE HURLED SO AS TO REACH THE
MOON AT A PARTICULAR POINT

IF THE PROJECTILE KEPT INDEFINITELY THE INITIAL SPEED OF  YARDS A
SECOND IT WOULD ONLY TAKE ABOUT NINE HOURS TO REACH ITS DESTINATION
BUT AS THAT INITIAL VELOCITY WILL GO ON DECREASING IT WILL HAPPEN
EVERYTHING CALCULATED UPON THAT THE PROJECTILE WILL TAKE 
SECONDS OR  HOURS AND  MINUTES TO REACH THE POINT WHERE THE
TERRESTRIAL AND LUNAR GRAVITATIONS ARE EQUAL AND FROM THAT POINT IT
WILL FALL UPON THE MOON IN  SECONDS OR  HOURS  MINUTES AND
 SECONDS IT MUST THEREFORE BE HURLED  HOURS  MINUTES AND 
SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE MOON AT THE POINT AIMED AT

REGARDING QUESTION NO  AT WHAT MOMENT WOULD THE MOON PRESENT THE
MOST FAVOURABLE POSITION FOR BEING REACHED BY THE PROJECTILE

ACCORDING TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE THE EPOCH OF THE MOONS PERIGEE
MUST FIRST BE CHOSEN AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHE WILL BE CROSSING HER
ZENITH WHICH WILL STILL FURTHER DIMINISH THE ENTIRE DISTANCE BY A
LENGTH EQUAL TO THE TERRESTRIAL RADIUSIE  MILES CONSEQUENTLY
THE PASSAGE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED WILL BE  MILES BUT THE MOON IS
NOT ALWAYS AT HER ZENITH WHEN SHE REACHES HER PERIGEE WHICH IS ONCE A
MONTH SHE IS ONLY UNDER THE TWO CONDITIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY AT LONG
INTERVALS OF TIME THIS COINCIDENCE OF PERIGEE AND ZENITH MUST BE WAITED
FOR IT HAPPENS FORTUNATELY THAT ON DECEMBER TH OF NEXT YEAR THE MOON
WILL OFFER THESE TWO CONDITIONS AT MIDNIGHT SHE WILL BE AT HER PERIGEE
AND HER ZENITHTHAT IS TO SAY AT HER SHORTEST DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH
AND AT HER ZENITH AT THE SAME TIME

REGARDING QUESTION NO  AT WHAT POINT IN THE HEAVENS OUGHT THE
CANNON DESTINED TO HURL THE PROJECTILE BE AIMED

THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS BEING ADMITTED THE CANNON OUGHT TO BE AIMED
AT THE ZENITH OF THE PLACE THE ZENITH IS THE SPOT SITUATED VERTICALLY
ABOVE THE HEAD OF A SPECTATOR SO THAT ITS RANGE WILL BE PERPENDICULAR
TO THE PLANE OF THE HORIZON AND THE PROJECTILE WILL PASS THE SOONEST
BEYOND THE RANGE OF TERRESTRIAL GRAVITATION BUT FOR THE MOON TO REACH
THE ZENITH OF A PLACE THAT PLACE MUST NOT EXCEED IN LATITUDE THE
DECLINATION OF THE LUMINARYIN OTHER WORDS IT MUST BE COMPRISED
BETWEEN DEG AND DEG OF NORTH OR SOUTH LATITUDE IN ANY OTHER PLACE THE
RANGE MUST NECESSARILY BE OBLIQUE WHICH WOULD SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE
SUCCESS OF THE EXPERIMENT

REGARDING QUESTION NO  WHAT PLACE WILL THE MOON OCCUPY IN THE
HEAVENS AT THE MOMENT OF THE PROJECTILES DEPARTURE

AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE PROJECTILE IS HURLED INTO SPACE THE MOON WHICH
TRAVELS FORWARD DEG   EACH DAY WILL BE FOUR TIMES AS DISTANT FROM
HER ZENITH POINTIE BY DEG   A SPACE WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE
DISTANCE SHE WILL TRAVEL DURING THE TRANSIT OF THE PROJECTILE BUT AS
THE DEVIATION WHICH THE ROTATORY MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH WILL IMPART TO
THE SHOCK MUST ALSO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND AS THE PROJECTILE CANNOT
REACH THE MOON UNTIL AFTER A DEVIATION EQUAL TO SIXTEEN RADII OF THE
EARTH WHICH CALCULATED UPON THE MOONS ORBIT IS EQUAL TO ABOUT DEG
IT IS NECESSARY TO ADD THESE DEG TO THOSE CAUSED BY THE
ALREADYMENTIONED DELAY OF THE MOON OR IN ROUND NUMBERS DEG THUS AT
THE MOMENT OF FIRING THE VISUAL RADIUS APPLIED TO THE MOON WILL
DESCRIBE WITH THE VERTICAL LINE OF THE PLACE AN ANGLE OF DEG

SUCH ARE THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS PROPOSED TO THE OBSERVATORY OF
CAMBRIDGE BY THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB

TO SUM UP

ST THE CANNON MUST BE PLACED IN A COUNTRY SITUATED BETWEEN DEG AND DEG
OF NORTH OR SOUTH LATITUDE

ND IT MUST BE AIMED AT THE ZENITH OF THE PLACE

RD THE PROJECTILE MUST HAVE AN INITIAL SPEED OF  YARDS A
SECOND

TH IT MUST BE HURLED ON DECEMBER ST OF NEXT YEAR AT HRS MINS
SECS PM

TH IT WILL MEET THE MOON FOUR DAYS AFTER ITS DEPARTURE ON DECEMBER
TH AT MIDNIGHT PRECISELY AT THE MOMENT SHE ARRIVES AT HER ZENITH

THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB OUGHT THEREFORE AT ONCE TO COMMENCE THE
LABOUR NECESSITATED BY SUCH AN ENTERPRISE AND BE READY TO PUT THEM INTO
EXECUTION AT THE MOMENT FIXED UPON FOR THEY WILL NOT FIND THE MOON IN
THE SAME CONDITIONS OF PERIGEE AND ZENITH TILL EIGHTEEN YEARS AND ELEVEN
DAYS LATER

THE STAFF OF THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE PUTS ITSELF ENTIRELY AT THEIR
DISPOSITION FOR QUESTIONS OF THEORETIC ASTRONOMY AND BEGS TO JOIN ITS
CONGRATULATIONS TO THOSE OF THE WHOLE OF AMERICA

ON BEHALF OF THE STAFF

JM BELFAST

DIRECTOR OF THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE




CHAPTER V

THE ROMANCE OF THE MOON


A SPECTATOR ENDOWED WITH INFINITE POWER OF SIGHT AND PLACED AT THE
UNKNOWN CENTRE ROUND WHICH GRAVITATES THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE SEEN
MYRIADS OF ATOMS FILLING ALL SPACE DURING THE CHAOTIC EPOCH OF CREATION
BUT BY DEGREES AS CENTURIES WENT ON A CHANGE TOOK PLACE A LAW OF
GRAVITATION MANIFESTED ITSELF WHICH THE WANDERING ATOMS OBEYED THESE
ATOMS COMBINED CHEMICALLY ACCORDING TO THEIR AFFINITIES FORMED
THEMSELVES INTO MOLECULES AND MADE THOSE NEBULOUS MASSES WITH WHICH THE
DEPTHS OF THE HEAVENS ARE STREWED

THESE MASSES WERE IMMEDIATELY ANIMATED BY A MOVEMENT OF ROTATION ROUND
THEIR CENTRAL POINT THIS CENTRE MADE OF VAGUE MOLECULES BEGAN TO TURN
ON ITSELF WHILST PROGRESSIVELY CONDENSING THEN FOLLOWING THE IMMUTABLE
LAWS OF MECHANICS IN PROPORTION AS ITS VOLUME BECAME DIMINISHED BY
CONDENSATION ITS MOVEMENT OF ROTATION WAS ACCELERATED AND THESE TWO
EFFECTS PERSISTING THERE RESULTED A PRINCIPAL PLANET THE CENTRE OF THE
NEBULOUS MASS

BY WATCHING ATTENTIVELY THE SPECTATOR WOULD THEN HAVE SEEN OTHER
MOLECULES IN THE MASS BEHAVE LIKE THE CENTRAL PLANET AND CONDENSE IN
THE SAME MANNER BY A MOVEMENT OF PROGRESSIVELYACCELERATED ROTATION AND
GRAVITATE ROUND IT UNDER THE FORM OF INNUMERABLE STARS THE NEBULAE OF
WHICH ASTRONOMERS COUNT NEARLY  AT PRESENT WERE FORMED

AMONGST THESE  NEBULAE THERE IS ONE THAT MEN HAVE CALLED THE MILKY
WAY AND WHICH CONTAINS EIGHTEEN MILLIONS OF STARS EACH OF WHICH HAS
BECOME THE CENTRE OF A SOLAR WORLD

IF THE SPECTATOR HAD THEN SPECIALLY EXAMINED AMONGST THESE EIGHTEEN
MILLIONS OF STARS ONE OF THE MOST MODEST AND LEAST BRILLIANT A STAR OF
THE FOURTH ORDER THE ONE THAT PROUDLY NAMED ITSELF THE SUN ALL THE
PHENOMENA TO WHICH THE FORMATION OF THE UNIVERSE IS DUE WOULD HAVE
SUCCESSIVELY TAKEN PLACE UNDER HIS EYES

IN FACT HE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THIS SUN STILL IN ITS GASEOUS STATE
AND COMPOSED OF MOBILE MOLECULES HE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IT TURNING ON
ITS OWN AXIS TO FINISH ITS WORK OF CONCENTRATION THIS MOVEMENT
FAITHFUL TO THE LAWS OF MECHANICS WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCELERATED BY THE
DIMINUTION OF VOLUME AND A TIME WOULD HAVE COME WHEN THE CENTRIFUGAL
FORCE WOULD HAVE OVERPOWERED THE CENTRIPETAL WHICH CAUSES THE MOLECULES
ALL TO TEND TOWARDS THE CENTRE

THEN ANOTHER PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE PASSED BEFORE THE EYES OF THE
SPECTATOR AND THE MOLECULES SITUATED IN THE PLANE OF THE EQUATOR WOULD
HAVE FORMED SEVERAL CONCENTRIC RINGS LIKE THAT OF SATURN ROUND THE SUN
IN THEIR TURN THESE RINGS OF COSMIC MATTER SEIZED WITH A MOVEMENT OF
ROTATION ROUND THE CENTRAL MASS WOULD HAVE BEEN BROKEN UP INTO
SECONDARY NEBULAETHAT IS TO SAY INTO PLANETS

IF THE SPECTATOR HAD THEN CONCENTRATED ALL HIS ATTENTION ON THESE
PLANETS HE WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM BEHAVE EXACTLY LIKE THE SUN AND GIVE
BIRTH TO ONE OR MORE COSMIC RINGS ORIGIN OF THOSE SECONDARY BODIES
WHICH WE CALL SATELLITES

THUS IN GOING UP FROM THE ATOM TO THE MOLECULE FROM THE MOLECULE TO THE
NEBULAE AND FROM THE NEBULAE TO THE PRINCIPAL STAR FROM THE PRINCIPAL
STAR TO THE SUN FROM THE SUN TO THE PLANET AND FROM THE PLANET TO THE
SATELLITE WE HAVE THE WHOLE SERIES OF TRANSFORMATIONS UNDERGONE BY THE
CELESTIAL POWERS FROM THE FIRST DAYS OF THE UNIVERSE

THE SUN SEEMS LOST AMIDST THE IMMENSITIES OF THE STELLAR UNIVERSE AND
YET IT IS RELATED BY ACTUAL THEORIES OF SCIENCE TO THE NEBULA OF THE
MILKY WAY CENTRE OF A WORLD AND SMALL AS IT APPEARS AMIDST THE
ETHEREAL REGIONS IT IS STILL ENORMOUS FOR ITS SIZE IS  TIMES
THAT OF THE EARTH AROUND IT GRAVITATE EIGHT PLANETS STRUCK OFF FROM
ITS OWN MASS IN THE FIRST DAYS OF CREATION THESE ARE IN PROCEEDING
FROM THE NEAREST TO THE MOST DISTANT MERCURY VENUS THE EARTH MARS
JUPITER SATURN URANUS AND NEPTUNE BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER CIRCULATE
REGULARLY OTHER SMALLER BODIES THE WANDERING DEBRIS PERHAPS OF A
STAR BROKEN UP INTO THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF WHICH THE TELESCOPE HAS
DISCOVERED EIGHTYTWO AT PRESENT SOME OF THESE ASTEROIDS ARE SO SMALL
THAT THEY COULD BE WALKED ROUND IN A SINGLE DAY BY GOING AT A GYMNASTIC
PACE

OF THESE ATTENDANT BODIES WHICH THE SUN MAINTAINS IN THEIR ELLIPTICAL
ORBIT BY THE GREAT LAW OF GRAVITATION SOME POSSESS SATELLITES OF THEIR
OWN URANUS HAS EIGHT SATURN EIGHT JUPITER FOUR NEPTUNE THREE
PERHAPS AND THE EARTH ONE THIS LATTER ONE OF THE LEAST IMPORTANT OF
THE SOLAR WORLD IS CALLED THE MOON AND IT IS THAT ONE THAT THE
ENTERPRISING GENIUS OF THE AMERICANS MEANS TO CONQUER

THE QUEEN OF NIGHT FROM HER RELATIVE PROXIMITY AND THE SPECTACLE
RAPIDLY RENEWED OF HER DIFFERENT PHASES AT FIRST DIVIDED THE ATTENTION
OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH WITH THE SUN BUT THE SUN TIRES THE
EYESIGHT AND THE SPLENDOUR OF ITS LIGHT FORCES ITS ADMIRERS TO LOWER
THEIR EYES

THE BLONDE PHOEBE MORE HUMANE GRACIOUSLY ALLOWS HERSELF TO BE SEEN IN
HER MODEST GRACE SHE IS GENTLE TO THE EYE NOT AMBITIOUS AND YET SHE
SOMETIMES ECLIPSES HER BROTHER THE RADIANT APOLLO WITHOUT EVER BEING
ECLIPSED BY HIM THE MAHOMMEDANS UNDERSTOOD WHAT GRATITUDE THEY OWED TO
THIS FAITHFUL FRIEND OF THE EARTH AND THEY RULED THEIR MONTHS AT 
DAYS ON HER REVOLUTION

THE FIRST PEOPLE OF THE WORLD DEDICATED PARTICULAR WORSHIP TO THIS
CHASTE GODDESS THE EGYPTIANS CALLED HER ISIS THE PHOENICIANS ASTARTE
THE GREEKS PHOEBE DAUGHTER OF JUPITER AND LATONA AND THEY EXPLAINED
HER ECLIPSES BY THE MYSTERIOUS VISITS OF DIANA AND THE HANDSOME
ENDYMION THE MYTHOLOGICAL LEGEND RELATES THAT THE NEMEAN LION TRAVERSED
THE COUNTRY OF THE MOON BEFORE ITS APPARITION UPON EARTH AND THE POET
AGESIANAX QUOTED BY PLUTARCH CELEBRATED IN HIS SWEET LINES ITS SOFT
EYES CHARMING NOSE AND ADMIRABLE MOUTH FORMED BY THE LUMINOUS PARTS
OF THE ADORABLE SELENE

BUT THOUGH THE ANCIENTS UNDERSTOOD THE CHARACTER TEMPERAMENT AND IN A
WORD MORAL QUALITIES OF THE MOON FROM A MYTHOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW THE
MOST LEARNED AMONGST THEM REMAINED VERY IGNORANT OF SELENOGRAPHY

SEVERAL ASTRONOMERS HOWEVER OF ANCIENT TIMES DISCOVERED CERTAIN
PARTICULARS NOW CONFIRMED BY SCIENCE THOUGH THE ARCADIANS PRETENDED
THEY HAD INHABITED THE EARTH AT AN EPOCH BEFORE THE MOON EXISTED THOUGH
SIMPLICIUS BELIEVED HER IMMOVABLE AND FASTENED TO THE CRYSTAL VAULT
THOUGH TACITUS LOOKED UPON HER AS A FRAGMENT BROKEN OFF FROM THE SOLAR
ORBIT AND CLEARCH THE DISCIPLE OF ARISTOTLE MADE OF HER A POLISHED
MIRROR UPON WHICH WERE REFLECTED THE IMAGES OF THE OCEANTHOUGH IN
SHORT OTHERS ONLY SAW IN HER A MASS OF VAPOURS EXHALED BY THE EARTH OR
A GLOBE HALF FIRE AND HALF ICE THAT TURNED ON ITSELF OTHER SAVANTS
BY MEANS OF WISE OBSERVATIONS AND WITHOUT OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS SUSPECTED
MOST OF THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE QUEEN OF NIGHT

THUS THALES OF MILETUS BC  GAVE OUT THE OPINION THAT THE MOON WAS
LIGHTED UP BY THE SUN ARISTARCHUS OF SAMOS GAVE THE RIGHT EXPLANATION
OF HER PHASES CLEOMENUS TAUGHT THAT SHE SHONE BY REFLECTED LIGHT
BEROSE THE CHALDEAN DISCOVERED THAT THE DURATION OF HER MOVEMENT OF
ROTATION WAS EQUAL TO THAT OF HER MOVEMENT OF REVOLUTION AND HE THUS
EXPLAINED WHY THE MOON ALWAYS PRESENTED THE SAME SIDE LASTLY
HIPPARCHUS  YEARS BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA DISCOVERED SOME
INEQUALITIES IN THE APPARENT MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTHS SATELLITE

THESE DIFFERENT OBSERVATIONS WERE AFTERWARDS CONFIRMED AND OTHER
ASTRONOMERS PROFITED BY THEM PTOLEMY IN THE SECOND CENTURY AND THE
ARABIAN ABOUL WEFA IN THE TENTH COMPLETED THE REMARKS OF HIPPARCHUS ON
THE INEQUALITIES THAT THE MOON UNDERGOES WHILST FOLLOWING THE UNDULATING
LINE OF ITS ORBIT UNDER THE ACTION OF THE SUN THEN COPERNICUS IN THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND TYCHO BRAHE IN THE SIXTEENTH COMPLETELY EXPOSED
THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD AND THE PART THAT THE MOON PLAYS AMONGST THE
CELESTIAL BODIES

AT THAT EPOCH HER MOVEMENTS WERE PRETTY WELL KNOWN BUT VERY LITTLE OF
HER PHYSICAL CONSTITUTION WAS KNOWN IT WAS THEN THAT GALILEO EXPLAINED
THE PHENOMENA OF LIGHT PRODUCED IN CERTAIN PHASES BY THE EXISTENCE OF
MOUNTAINS TO WHICH HE GAVE AN AVERAGE HEIGHT OF  FEET

AFTER HIM HEVELIUS AN ASTRONOMER OF DANTZIG LOWERED THE HIGHEST
ALTITUDES TO  FEET BUT HIS CONTEMPORARY RICCIOLI BROUGHT THEM
UP AGAIN TO  FEET

HERSCHEL AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ARMED WITH A POWERFUL
TELESCOPE CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE PRECEDING MEASUREMENTS HE GAVE A
HEIGHT OF  FEET TO THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS AND BROUGHT DOWN THE
AVERAGE OF DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LITTLE MORE THAN  FEET BUT
HERSCHEL WAS MISTAKEN TOO AND THE OBSERVATIONS OF SCHROETER LOUVILLE
HALLEY NASMYTH BIANCHINI PASTORFF LOHRMAN GRUITHUYSEN AND
ESPECIALLY THE PATIENT STUDIES OF MM BOEER AND MOEDLER WERE NECESSARY
TO DEFINITELY RESOLVE THE QUESTION THANKS TO THESE SAVANTS THE
ELEVATION OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON IS NOW PERFECTLY KNOWN BOEER AND
MOEDLER MEASURED  DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS OF WHICH SIX EXCEED 
FEET AND TWENTYTWO EXCEED  FEET THEIR HIGHEST SUMMIT TOWERS TO A
HEIGHT OF  FEET ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE LUNAR DISC

AT THE SAME TIME THE SURVEY OF THE MOON WAS BEING COMPLETED SHE
APPEARED RIDDLED WITH CRATERS AND HER ESSENTIALLY VOLCANIC NATURE WAS
AFFIRMED BY EACH OBSERVATION FROM THE ABSENCE OF REFRACTION IN THE RAYS
OF THE PLANETS OCCULTED BY HER IT IS CONCLUDED THAT SHE CAN HAVE NO
ATMOSPHERE THIS ABSENCE OF AIR ENTAILS ABSENCE OF WATER IT THEREFORE
BECAME MANIFEST THAT THE SELENITES IN ORDER TO LIVE UNDER SUCH
CONDITIONS MUST HAVE A SPECIAL ORGANISATION AND DIFFER SINGULARLY FROM
THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH

LASTLY THANKS TO NEW METHODS MORE PERFECTED INSTRUMENTS SEARCHED THE
MOON WITHOUT INTERMISSION LEAVING NOT A POINT OF HER SURFACE
UNEXPLORED AND YET HER DIAMETER MEASURES  MILES HER SURFACE IS
ONETHIRTEENTH OF THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE AND HER VOLUME
ONEFORTYNINTH OF THE VOLUME OF THE TERRESTRIAL SPHEROID BUT NONE OF
HER SECRETS COULD ESCAPE THE ASTRONOMERS EYES AND THESE CLEVER
SAVANTS CARRIED THEIR WONDERFUL OBSERVATIONS STILL FURTHER

THUS THEY REMARKED THAT WHEN THE MOON WAS AT HER FULL THE DISC APPEARED
IN CERTAIN PLACES STRIPED WITH WHITE LINES AND DURING HER PHASES
STRIPED WITH BLACK LINES BY PROSECUTING THE STUDY OF THESE WITH GREATER
PRECISION THEY SUCCEEDED IN MAKING OUT THE EXACT NATURE OF THESE LINES
THEY ARE LONG AND NARROW FURROWS SUNK BETWEEN PARALLEL RIDGES BORDERING
GENERALLY UPON THE EDGES OF THE CRATERS THEIR LENGTH VARIED FROM TEN TO
ONE HUNDRED MILES AND THEIR WIDTH WAS ABOUT  YARDS ASTRONOMERS
CALLED THEM FURROWS AND THAT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO THEY COULD NOT
ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY WERE THE DRIEDUP BEDS OF ANCIENT RIVERS OR NOT
THE AMERICANS HOPE SOME DAY OR OTHER TO DETERMINE THIS GEOLOGICAL
QUESTION THEY ALSO UNDERTAKE TO RECONNOITRE THE SERIES OF PARALLEL
RAMPARTS DISCOVERED ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON BY GRUITHUYSEN A LEARNED
PROFESSOR OF MUNICH WHO CONSIDERED THEM TO BE A SYSTEM OF ELEVATED
FORTIFICATIONS RAISED BY SELENITE ENGINEERS THESE TWO STILL OBSCURE
POINTS AND DOUBTLESS MANY OTHERS CAN ONLY BE DEFINITELY SETTLED BY
DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE MOON

AS TO THE INTENSITY OF HER LIGHT THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE LEARNT IT
IS  TIMES WEAKER THAN THAT OF THE SUN AND ITS HEAT HAS NO
APPRECIABLE ACTION UPON THERMOMETERS AS TO THE PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THE
ASHY LIGHT IT IS NATURALLY EXPLAINED BY THE EFFECT OF THE SUNS RAYS
TRANSMITTED FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON AND WHICH SEEM TO COMPLETE THE
LUNAR DISC WHEN IT PRESENTS A CRESCENT FORM DURING ITS FIRST AND LAST
PHASES

SUCH WAS THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED RESPECTING THE EARTHS
SATELLITE WHICH THE GUN CLUB UNDERTOOK TO PERFECT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS
COSMOGRAPHICAL GEOGRAPHICAL GEOLOGICAL POLITICAL AND MORAL




CHAPTER VI

WHAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE AND WHAT IS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO BE
BELIEVED IN THE UNITED STATES


THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF BARBICANES PROPOSITION WAS THAT OF BRINGING OUT
ALL ASTRONOMICAL FACTS RELATIVE TO THE QUEEN OF NIGHT EVERYBODY BEGAN
TO STUDY HER ASSIDUOUSLY IT SEEMED AS IF THE MOON HAD APPEARED ON THE
HORIZON FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THAT NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN HER IN THE SKY
BEFORE SHE BECAME THE FASHION SHE WAS THE LION OF THE DAY WITHOUT
APPEARING LESS MODEST ON THAT ACCOUNT AND TOOK HER PLACE AMONGST THE
STARS WITHOUT BEING ANY THE PROUDER THE NEWSPAPERS REVIVED OLD
ANECDOTES IN WHICH THIS SUN OF THE WOLVES PLAYED A PART THEY RECALLED
THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE IGNORANCE OF PAST AGES HAD ASCRIBED TO HER THEY
SANG ABOUT HER IN EVERY TONE A LITTLE MORE AND THEY WOULD HAVE QUOTED
HER WITTY SAYINGS THE WHOLE OF AMERICA WAS FILLED WITH SELENOMANIA

THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS TREATED THE QUESTION WHICH TOUCHED UPON THE
ENTERPRISE OF THE GUN CLUB MORE SPECIALLY THEY PUBLISHED THE LETTER
FROM THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE THEY COMMENTED UPON IT AND APPROVED
OF IT WITHOUT RESERVE

IN SHORT EVEN THE MOST IGNORANT YANKEE WAS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO BE
IGNORANT OF A SINGLE FACT RELATIVE TO HIS SATELLITE NOR TO THE OLDEST
WOMEN AMONGST THEM TO HAVE ANY SUPERSTITIONS ABOUT HER LEFT SCIENCE
FLOODED THEM IT PENETRATED INTO THEIR EYES AND EARS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO BE AN ASSIN ASTRONOMY

UNTIL THEN MANY PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE EARTH
AND THE MOON HAD BEEN CALCULATED THIS FACT WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF TO
EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT IT WAS DONE BY MEASURING THE PARALLAX OF THE MOON
IF THE WORD PARALLAX SEEMED NEW TO THEM THEY WERE TOLD IT WAS THE
ANGLE FORMED BY TWO STRAIGHT LINES DRAWN FROM EITHER EXTREMITY OF THE
EARTHS RADIUS TO THE MOON IF THEY WERE IN DOUBT ABOUT THE PERFECTION
OF THIS METHOD IT WAS IMMEDIATELY PROVED TO THEM THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE
MEAN DISTANCE  MILES BUT THAT ASTRONOMERS WERE RIGHT TO WITHIN
SEVENTY MILES

TO THOSE WHO WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MOON THE
NEWSPAPERS DEMONSTRATED DAILY THAT SHE POSSESSES TWO DISTINCT MOVEMENTS
THE FIRST BEING THAT OF ROTATION UPON HER AXIS THE SECOND THAT OF
REVOLUTION ROUND THE EARTH ACCOMPLISHING BOTH IN THE SAME TIMETHAT IS
TO SAY IN  DAYS

THE MOVEMENT OF ROTATION IS THE ONE THAT CAUSES NIGHT AND DAY ON THE
SURFACE OF THE MOON ONLY THERE IS BUT ONE DAY AND ONE NIGHT IN A LUNAR
MONTH AND THEY EACH LAST  HOURS BUT HAPPILY THE FACE TURNED
TOWARDS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE IS LIGHTED BY IT WITH AN INTENSITY EQUAL
TO THE LIGHT OF FOURTEEN MOONS AS TO THE OTHER FACE THE ONE ALWAYS
INVISIBLE IT HAS NATURALLY  HOURS OF ABSOLUTE NIGHT TEMPERED ONLY
BY THE PALE LIGHT THAT FALLS FROM THE STARS THIS PHENOMENON IS DUE
SOLELY TO THE PECULIARITY THAT THE MOVEMENTS OF ROTATION AND REVOLUTION
ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN RIGOROUSLY EQUAL PERIODS A PHENOMENON WHICH
ACCORDING TO CASSINI AND HERSCHEL IS COMMON TO THE SATELLITES OF
JUPITER AND VERY PROBABLY TO THE OTHER SATELLITES

SOME WELLDISPOSED BUT RATHER UNYIELDING MINDS DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND
AT FIRST HOW IF THE MOON INVARIABLY SHOWS THE SAME FACE TO THE EARTH
DURING HER REVOLUTION SHE DESCRIBES ONE TURN ROUND HERSELF IN THE SAME
PERIOD OF TIME TO SUCH IT WAS ANSWEREDGO INTO YOUR DININGROOM AND
TURN ROUND THE TABLE SO AS ALWAYS TO KEEP YOUR FACE TOWARDS THE CENTRE
WHEN YOUR CIRCULAR WALK IS ENDED YOU WILL HAVE DESCRIBED ONE CIRCLE
ROUND YOURSELVES SINCE YOUR EYE WILL HAVE SUCCESSIVELY TRAVERSED EVERY
POINT OF THE ROOM WELL THEN THE ROOM IS THE HEAVENS THE TABLE IS THE
EARTH AND YOU ARE THE MOON

AND THEY GO AWAY DELIGHTED WITH THE COMPARISON

THUS THEN THE MOON ALWAYS PRESENTS THE SAME FACE TO THE EARTH STILL
TO BE QUITE EXACT IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF CERTAIN
FLUCTUATIONS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND FROM WEST TO EAST CALLED
LIBRATION SHE SHOWS RATHER MORE THAN THE HALF OF HER DISC ABOUT 

WHEN THE IGNORAMUSES KNEW AS MUCH AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CAMBRIDGE
OBSERVATORY ABOUT THE MOONS MOVEMENT OF ROTATION THEY BEGAN TO MAKE
THEMSELVES UNEASY ABOUT HER MOVEMENT OF REVOLUTION ROUND THE EARTH AND
TWENTY SCIENTIFIC REVIEWS QUICKLY GAVE THEM THE INFORMATION THEY WANTED
THEY THEN LEARNT THAT THE FIRMAMENT WITH ITS INFINITE STARS MAY BE
LOOKED UPON AS A VAST DIAL UPON WHICH THE MOON MOVES INDICATING THE
TIME TO ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH THAT IT IS IN THIS MOVEMENT
THAT THE QUEEN OF NIGHT SHOWS HERSELF IN HER DIFFERENT PHASES THAT SHE
IS FULL WHEN SHE IS IN OPPOSITION WITH THE SUNTHAT IS TO SAY WHEN THE
THREE BODIES ARE ON A LINE WITH EACH OTHER THE EARTH BEING IN THE
CENTRE THAT THE MOON IS NEW WHEN SHE IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
SUNTHAT IS TO SAY WHEN SHE IS BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE EARTH LASTLY
THAT THE MOON IS IN HER FIRST OR LAST QUARTER WHEN SHE MAKES WITH THE
SUN AND THE EARTH A RIGHT ANGLE OF WHICH SHE OCCUPIES THE APEX

SOME PERSPICACIOUS YANKEES INFERRED IN CONSEQUENCE THAT ECLIPSES COULD
ONLY TAKE PLACE AT THE PERIODS OF CONJUNCTION OR OPPOSITION AND THEIR
REASONING WAS JUST IN CONJUNCTION THE MOON CAN ECLIPSE THE SUN WHILST
IN OPPOSITION IT IS THE EARTH THAT CAN ECLIPSE HIM IN HER TURN AND THE
REASON THESE ECLIPSES DO NOT HAPPEN TWICE IN A LUNAR MONTH IS BECAUSE
THE PLANE UPON WHICH THE MOON MOVES IS ELLIPTICAL LIKE THAT OF THE
EARTH

AS TO THE HEIGHT WHICH THE QUEEN OF NIGHT CAN ATTAIN ABOVE THE HORIZON
THE LETTER FROM THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE CONTAINED ALL THAT CAN BE
SAID ABOUT IT EVERY ONE KNEW THAT THIS HEIGHT VARIES ACCORDING TO THE
LATITUDE OF THE PLACE WHERE THE OBSERVATION IS TAKEN BUT THE ONLY ZONES
OF THE GLOBE WHERE THE MOON REACHES HER ZENITHTHAT IS TO SAY WHERE
SHE IS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE SPECTATORSARE NECESSARILY
COMPRISED BETWEEN THE TH PARALLELS AND THE EQUATOR HENCE THE
IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION GIVEN TO ATTEMPT THE EXPERIMENT UPON SOME POINT
IN THIS PART OF THE GLOBE IN ORDER THAT THE PROJECTILE MAY BE HURLED
PERPENDICULARLY AND MAY THUS MORE QUICKLY ESCAPE THE ATTRACTION OF
GRAVITATION THIS WAS A CONDITION ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE
ENTERPRISE AND PUBLIC OPINION WAS MUCH EXERCISED THEREUPON

AS TO THE LINE FOLLOWED BY THE MOON IN HER REVOLUTION ROUND THE EARTH
THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE HAD DEMONSTRATED TO THE MOST IGNORANT THAT
IT IS AN ELLIPSE OF WHICH THE EARTH OCCUPIES ONE OF THE FOCI THESE
ELLIPTICAL ORBITS ARE COMMON TO ALL THE PLANETS AS WELL AS TO ALL THE
SATELLITES AND RATIONAL MECHANISM RIGOROUSLY PROVES THAT IT COULD NOT
BE OTHERWISE IT WAS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN AT HER APOGEE THE MOON
WAS FARTHEST FROM THE EARTH AND WHEN AT HER PERIGEE SHE WAS NEAREST TO
OUR PLANET

THIS THEREFORE WAS WHAT EVERY AMERICAN KNEW WHETHER HE WISHED TO OR
NO AND WHAT NO ONE COULD DECENTLY BE IGNORANT OF BUT IF THESE TRUE
PRINCIPLES RAPIDLY MADE THEIR WAY CERTAIN ILLUSIVE FEARS AND MANY
ERRORS WERE WITH DIFFICULTY CLEARED AWAY

SOME WORTHY PEOPLE MAINTAINED FOR INSTANCE THAT THE MOON WAS AN
ANCIENT COMET WHICH WHILST TRAVELLING ALONG ITS ELONGATED ORBIT ROUND
THE SUN PASSED NEAR TO THE EARTH AND WAS RETAINED IN HER CIRCLE OF
ATTRACTION THE DRAWINGROOM ASTRONOMERS PRETENDED TO EXPLAIN THUS THE
BURNT ASPECT OF THE MOON A MISFORTUNE OF WHICH THEY ACCUSED THE SUN
ONLY WHEN THEY WERE TOLD TO NOTICE THAT COMETS HAVE AN ATMOSPHERE AND
THAT THE MOON HAS LITTLE OR NONE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER

OTHERS BELONGING TO THE CLASS OF SHAKERS MANIFESTED CERTAIN FEARS
ABOUT THE MOON THEY HAD HEARD THAT SINCE THE OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE
TIMES OF THE CALIPHS HER MOVEMENT OF REVOLUTION HAD ACCELERATED IN A
CERTAIN PROPORTION THEY THENCE VERY LOGICALLY CONCLUDED THAT AN
ACCELERATION OF MOVEMENT MUST CORRESPOND TO A DIMINUTION IN THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES AND THAT THIS DOUBLE EFFECT GOING ON INFINITELY
THE MOON WOULD ONE DAY END BY FALLING INTO THE EARTH HOWEVER THEY WERE
OBLIGED TO REASSURE THEMSELVES AND CEASE TO FEAR FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
WHEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT ACCORDING TO THE CALCULATIONS OF LAPLACE AN
ILLUSTRIOUS FRENCH MATHEMATICIAN THIS ACCELERATION OF MOVEMENT WAS
RESTRICTED WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS AND THAT A PROPORTIONAL DIMINUTION
WILL FOLLOW IT THUS THE EQUILIBRIUM OF THE SOLAR WORLD CANNOT BE
DISTURBED IN FUTURE CENTURIES

LASTLY THERE WAS THE SUPERSTITIOUS CLASS OF IGNORAMUSES TO BE DEALT
WITH THESE ARE NOT CONTENT WITH BEING IGNORANT THEY KNOW WHAT DOES NOT
EXIST AND ABOUT THE MOON THEY KNOW A GREAT DEAL SOME OF THEM
CONSIDERED HER DISC TO BE A POLISHED MIRROR BY MEANS OF WHICH PEOPLE
MIGHT SEE THEMSELVES FROM DIFFERENT POINTS ON THE EARTH AND COMMUNICATE
THEIR THOUGHTS TO ONE ANOTHER OTHERS PRETENDED THAT OUT OF  NEW
MOONS  HAD BROUGHT SOME NOTABLE CHANGE SUCH AS CATACLYSMS
REVOLUTIONS EARTHQUAKES DELUGES C THEY THEREFORE BELIEVED IN THE
MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE OF THE QUEEN OF NIGHT ON HUMAN DESTINIES THEY
THINK THAT EVERY SELENITE IS CONNECTED BY SOME SYMPATHETIC TIE WITH EACH
INHABITANT OF THE EARTH THEY PRETEND WITH DR MEAD THAT SHE ENTIRELY
GOVERNS THE VITAL SYSTEMTHAT BOYS ARE BORN DURING THE NEW MOON AND
GIRLS DURING HER LAST QUARTER C C BUT AT LAST IT BECAME NECESSARY
TO GIVE UP THESE VULGAR ERRORS TO COME BACK TO TRUTH AND IF THE MOON
STRIPPED OF HER INFLUENCE LOST HER PRESTIGE IN THE MINDS OF COURTESANS
OF EVERY POWER IF SOME TURNED THEIR BACKS ON HER THE IMMENSE MAJORITY
WERE IN HER FAVOUR AS TO THE YANKEES THEY HAD NO OTHER AMBITION THAN
THAT OF TAKING POSSESSION OF THIS NEW CONTINENT OF THE SKY AND TO PLANT
UPON ITS HIGHEST SUMMIT THE STARSPANGLED BANNER OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA




CHAPTER VII

THE HYMN OF THE CANNONBALL


THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY HAD IN ITS MEMORABLE LETTER OF OCTOBER TH
TREATED THE QUESTION FROM AN ASTRONOMICAL POINT OF VIEWTHE MECHANICAL
POINT HAD STILL TO BE TREATED IT WAS THEN THAT THE PRACTICAL
DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE TO ANY OTHER COUNTRY BUT
AMERICA BUT THERE THEY WERE LOOKED UPON AS PLAY

PRESIDENT BARBICANE HAD WITHOUT LOSING ANY TIME NOMINATED A WORKING
COMMITTEE IN THE HEART OF THE GUN CLUB THIS COMMITTEE WAS IN THREE
SITTINGS TO ELUCIDATE THE THREE GREAT QUESTIONS OF THE CANNON THE
PROJECTILE AND THE POWDER IT WAS COMPOSED OF FOUR MEMBERS VERY LEARNED
UPON THESE MATTERS BARBICANE HAD THE CASTING VOTE AND WITH HIM WERE
ASSOCIATED GENERAL MORGAN MAJOR ELPHINSTONE AND LASTLY THE
INEVITABLE JT MASTON TO WHOM WERE CONFIDED THE FUNCTIONS OF
SECRETARY

ON THE TH OF OCTOBER THE COMMITTEE MET AT PRESIDENT BARBICANES HOUSE
NO  REPUBLICANSTREET AS IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE STOMACH SHOULD
NOT TROUBLE SO IMPORTANT A DEBATE THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB TOOK
THEIR SEATS AT A TABLE COVERED WITH SANDWICHES AND TEAPOTS JT MASTON
IMMEDIATELY SCREWED HIS PEN ON TO HIS STEEL HOOK AND THE BUSINESS BEGAN

BARBICANE OPENED THE MEETING AS FOLLOWS

DEAR COLLEAGUES SAID HE WE HAVE TO SOLVE ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT
PROBLEMS IN BALLISTICSTHAT GREATEST OF SCIENCES WHICH TREATS OF THE
MOVEMENT OF PROJECTILESTHAT IS TO SAY OF BODIES HURLED INTO SPACE BY
SOME POWER OF IMPULSION AND THEN LEFT TO THEMSELVES

OH BALLISTICS BALLISTICS CRIED JT MASTON IN A VOICE OF EMOTION

PERHAPS CONTINUED BARBICANE THE MOST LOGICAL THING WOULD BE TO
CONSECRATE THIS FIRST MEETING TO DISCUSSING THE ENGINE

CERTAINLY ANSWERED GENERAL MORGAN

NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED BARBICANE AFTER MATURE DELIBERATION IT
SEEMS TO ME THAT THE QUESTION OF THE PROJECTILE OUGHT TO PRECEDE THAT OF
THE CANNON AND THAT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE LATTER OUGHT TO DEPEND UPON
THE DIMENSIONS OF THE FORMER

JT MASTON HERE INTERRUPTED THE PRESIDENT AND WAS HEARD WITH THE
ATTENTION WHICH HIS MAGNIFICENT PAST CAREER DESERVED

MY DEAR FRIENDS SAID HE IN AN INSPIRED TONE OUR PRESIDENT IS RIGHT
TO GIVE THE QUESTION OF THE PROJECTILE THE PRECEDENCE OF EVERY OTHER
THE CANNONBALL WE MEAN TO HURL AT THE MOON WILL BE OUR MESSENGER OUR
AMBASSADOR AND I ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO REGARD IT FROM AN ENTIRELY
MORAL POINT OF VIEW

THIS NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT A PROJECTILE EXCITED THE CURIOSITY OF THE
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THEY THEREFORE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE
WORDS OF JT MASTON

MY DEAR COLLEAGUES HE CONTINUED I WILL BE BRIEF I WILL LAY ASIDE
THE MATERIAL PROJECTILETHE PROJECTILE THAT KILLSIN ORDER TO TAKE UP
THE MATHEMATICAL PROJECTILETHE MORAL PROJECTILE A CANNONBALL IS TO
ME THE MOST BRILLIANT MANIFESTATION OF HUMAN POWER AND BY CREATING IT
MAN HAS APPROACHED NEAREST TO THE CREATOR

HEAR HEAR SAID MAJOR ELPHINSTONE

IN FACT CRIED THE ORATOR IF GOD HAS MADE THE STARS AND THE PLANETS
MAN HAS MADE THE CANNONBALLTHAT CRITERION OF TERRESTRIAL SPEEDTHAT
REDUCTION OF BODIES WANDERING IN SPACE WHICH ARE REALLY NOTHING BUT
PROJECTILES LET PROVIDENCE CLAIM THE SPEED OF ELECTRICITY LIGHT THE
STARS COMETS PLANETS SATELLITES SOUND AND WIND BUT OURS IS THE
SPEED OF THE CANNONBALLA HUNDRED TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF TRAINS
AND THE FASTEST HORSES

JT MASTON WAS INSPIRED HIS ACCENTS BECAME QUITE LYRICAL AS HE CHANTED
THE HYMN CONSECRATED TO THE PROJECTILE

WOULD YOU LIKE FIGURES CONTINUED HE HERE ARE ELOQUENT ONES TAKE
THE SIMPLE  POUNDER THOUGH IT MOVES  TIMES SLOWER THAN
ELECTRICITY  TIMES SLOWER THAN LIGHT  TIMES SLOWER THAN THE
EARTH IN HER MOVEMENT OF TRANSLATION ROUND THE SUN YET WHEN IT LEAVES
THE CANNON IT GOES QUICKER THAN SOUND IT GOES AT THE RATE OF  MILES A
MINUTE  MILES AN HOUR  MILES A DAYTHAT IS TO SAY AT THE
SPEED OF THE POINTS OF THE EQUATOR IN THE GLOBES MOVEMENT OF ROTATION
 MILES A YEAR IT WOULD THEREFORE TAKE  DAYS TO GET TO THE
MOON  YEARS TO GET TO THE SUN  YEARS TO REACH NEPTUNE AT THE
LIMITS OF THE SOLAR WORLD THAT IS WHAT THIS MODEST CANNONBALL THE
WORK OF OUR HANDS CAN DO WHAT WILL IT BE THEREFORE WHEN WITH TWENTY
TIMES THAT SPEED WE SHALL HURL IT WITH A RAPIDITY OF SEVEN MILES A
SECOND AH SPLENDID SHOT SUPERB PROJECTILE I LIKE TO THINK YOU WILL
BE RECEIVED UP THERE WITH THE HONOURS DUE TO A TERRESTRIAL AMBASSADOR

CHEERS GREETED THIS BRILLIANT PERORATION AND JT MASTON OVERCOME WITH
EMOTION SAT DOWN AMIDST THE FELICITATIONS OF HIS COLLEAGUES

AND NOW SAID BARBICANE THAT WE HAVE GIVEN SOME TIME TO POETRY LET
US PROCEED TO FACTS

WE ARE READY ANSWERED THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS THEY EACH
DEMOLISHED HALFADOZEN SANDWICHES

YOU KNOW WHAT PROBLEM IT IS WE HAVE TO SOLVE CONTINUED THE PRESIDENT
IT IS THAT OF ENDOWING A PROJECTILE WITH A SPEED OF  YARDS PER
SECOND I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL SUCCEED BUT AT
PRESENT LET US SEE WHAT SPEEDS WE HAVE ALREADY OBTAINED GENERAL MORGAN
CAN EDIFY US UPON THAT SUBJECT

SO MUCH THE MORE EASILY ANSWERED THE GENERAL BECAUSE DURING THE WAR
I WAS A MEMBER OF THE EXPERIMENT COMMISSION THE POUND CANNON OF
DAHLGREN WITH A RANGE OF  YARDS GAVE THEIR PROJECTILES AN INITIAL
SPEED OF  YARDS A SECOND

YES AND THE RODMAN COLUMBIAD THE AMERICANS GAVE THE NAME OF
COLUMBIAD TO THEIR ENORMOUS ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION ASKED THE
PRESIDENT

THE RODMAN COLUMBIAD TRIED AT FORT HAMILTON NEAR NEW YORK HURLED A
PROJECTILE WEIGHING HALF A TON A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES WITH A SPEED
OF  YARDS A SECOND A RESULT WHICH NEITHER ARMSTRONG NOR PALLISER HAS
OBTAINED IN ENGLAND

ENGLISHMEN ARE NOWHERE SAID JT MASTON POINTING HIS FORMIDABLE
STEEL HOOK EASTWARD

THEN RESUMED BARBICANE A SPEED OF  YARDS IS THE MAXIMUM OBTAINED
AT PRESENT

YES ANSWERED MORGAN

I MIGHT ADD HOWEVER REPLIED JT MASTON THAT IF MY MORTAR HAD NOT
BEEN BLOWN UP

YES BUT IT WAS BLOWN UP REPLIED BARBICANE WITH A BENEVOLENT GESTURE
WE MUST TAKE THE SPEED OF  YARDS FOR A STARTING POINT WE MUST KEEP
TILL ANOTHER MEETING THE DISCUSSION OF THE MEANS USED TO PRODUCE THIS
SPEED ALLOW ME TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE DIMENSIONS WHICH OUR
PROJECTILE MUST HAVE OF COURSE IT MUST BE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT TO
ONE OF HALF A TON WEIGHT

WHY ASKED THE MAJOR

BECAUSE QUICKLY ANSWERED JT MASTON IT MUST BE LARGE ENOUGH TO
ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE MOON SUPPOSING THERE
ARE ANY

YES ANSWERED BARBICANE AND FOR ANOTHER REASON STILL MORE
IMPORTANT

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BARBICANE ASKED THE MAJOR

I MEAN THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SEND UP A PROJECTILE AND THEN TO THINK
NO MORE ABOUT IT WE MUST FOLLOW IT IN ITS TRANSIT

WHAT SAID THE GENERAL SLIGHTLY SURPRISED AT THE PROPOSITION

CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE LIKE A MAN WHO KNEW WHAT HE WAS SAYING
OR OUR EXPERIMENT WILL BE WITHOUT RESULT

BUT THEN REPLIED THE MAJOR YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE THE PROJECTILE
ENORMOUS DIMENSIONS

NO PLEASE GRANT ME YOUR ATTENTION YOU KNOW THAT OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS
HAVE ACQUIRED GREAT PERFECTION CERTAIN TELESCOPES INCREASE OBJECTS SIX
THOUSAND AND BRING THE MOON TO WITHIN A DISTANCE OF FORTY MILES NOW AT
THAT DISTANCE OBJECTS SIXTY FEET SQUARE ARE PERFECTLY VISIBLE THE POWER
OF PENETRATION OF THE TELESCOPE HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED BECAUSE THAT
POWER IS ONLY EXERCISED TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEIR CLEARNESS AND THE
MOON WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTING MIRROR DOES NOT SEND A LIGHT INTENSE
ENOUGH FOR THE TELESCOPES TO INCREASE OBJECTS BEYOND THAT LIMIT

VERY WELL THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO ASKED THE GENERAL DO YOU
INTEND GIVING A DIAMETER OF SIXTY FEET TO YOUR PROJECTILE

NO

YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE UPON YOURSELF THE TASK OF MAKING THE MOON
MORE LUMINOUS

I AM THOUGH

THATS RATHER STRONG EXCLAIMED MASTON

YES BUT SIMPLE ANSWERED BARBICANE IF I SUCCEED IN LESSENING THE
DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH THE MOONS LIGHT TRAVERSES SHALL I NOT
RENDER THAT LIGHT MORE INTENSE

EVIDENTLY

IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THAT RESULT I SHALL ONLY HAVE TO ESTABLISH MY
TELESCOPE UPON SOME HIGH MOUNTAIN WE CAN DO THAT

I GIVE IN ANSWERED THE MAJOR YOU HAVE SUCH A WAY OF SIMPLIFYING
THINGS WHAT ENLARGEMENT DO YOU HOPE TO OBTAIN THUS

ONE OF  TIMES WHICH WILL BRING THE MOON WITHIN FIVE MILES ONLY
AND OBJECTS WILL ONLY NEED A DIAMETER OF NINE FEET

PERFECT EXCLAIMED JT MASTON THEN OUR PROJECTILE WILL HAVE A
DIAMETER OF NINE FEET

PRECISELY

ALLOW ME TO INFORM YOU HOWEVER RETURNED MAJOR ELPHINSTONE THAT ITS
WEIGHT WILL STILL BE

OH MAJOR ANSWERED BARBICANE BEFORE DISCUSSING ITS WEIGHT ALLOW ME
TO TELL YOU THAT OUR FOREFATHERS DID MARVELS IN THAT WAY FAR BE IT FROM
ME TO PRETEND THAT BALLISTICS HAVE NOT PROGRESSED BUT IT IS WELL TO
KNOW THAT IN THE MIDDLE AGES SURPRISING RESULTS WERE OBTAINED I DARE
AFFIRM EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN OURS

JUSTIFY YOUR STATEMENT EXCLAIMED JT MASTON

NOTHING IS EASIER ANSWERED BARBICANE I CAN GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES
AT THE SIEGE OF CONSTANTINOPLE BY MAHOMET II IN  THEY HURLED
STONE BULLETS THAT WEIGHED  LBS AT MALTA IN THE TIME OF ITS
KNIGHTS A CERTAIN CANNON OF FORT SAINT ELME HURLED PROJECTILES WEIGHING
 LBS ACCORDING TO A FRENCH HISTORIAN UNDER LOUIS XI A MORTAR
HURLED A BOMB OF  LBS ONLY BUT THAT BOMB FIRED AT THE BASTILLE A
PLACE WHERE MAD MEN IMPRISONED WISE ONES FELL AT CHARENTON WHERE WISE
MEN IMPRISON MAD ONES

VERY WELL SAID JT MASTON

SINCE WHAT HAVE WE SEEN AFTER ALL THE ARMSTRONG CANNONS HURL
PROJECTILES OF  LBS AND THE RODMAN COLUMBIADS PROJECTILES OF HALF A
TON IT SEEMS THEN THAT IF PROJECTILES HAVE INCREASED IN RANGE THEY
HAVE LOST IN WEIGHT NOW IF WE TURN OUR EFFORTS IN THAT DIRECTION WE
MUST SUCCEED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE SCIENCE IN DOUBLING THE WEIGHT OF
THE PROJECTILES OF MAHOMET II AND THE KNIGHTS OF MALTA

THAT IS EVIDENT ANSWERED THE MAJOR BUT WHAT METAL DO YOU INTEND TO
EMPLOY FOR YOUR OWN PROJECTILE

SIMPLY CASTIRON SAID GENERAL MORGAN

CASTIRON EXCLAIMED JT MASTON DISDAINFULLY THATS VERY COMMON FOR
A BULLET DESTINED TO GO TO THE MOON

DO NOT LET US EXAGGERATE MY HONOURABLE FRIEND ANSWERED MORGAN
CASTIRON WILL BE SUFFICIENT

THEN REPLIED MAJOR ELPHINSTONE AS THE WEIGHT OF THE PROJECTILE IS
IN PROPORTION TO ITS VOLUME A CASTIRON BULLET MEASURING NINE FEET IN
DIAMETER WILL STILL BE FRIGHTFULLY HEAVY

YES IF IT BE SOLID BUT NOT IF IT BE HOLLOW SAID BARBICANE

HOLLOWTHEN IT WILL BE AN OBUS

IN WHICH WE CAN PUT DESPATCHES REPLIED JT MASTON AND SPECIMENS OF
OUR TERRESTRIAL PRODUCTIONS

YES AN OBUS ANSWERED BARBICANE THAT IS WHAT IT MUST BE A SOLID
BULLET OF  INCHES WOULD WEIGH MORE THAN  LBS A WEIGHT
EVIDENTLY TOO GREAT HOWEVER AS IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE THE PROJECTILE
A CERTAIN STABILITY I PROPOSE TO GIVE IT A WEIGHT OF  LBS

WHAT WILL BE THE THICKNESS OF THE METAL ASKED THE MAJOR

IF WE FOLLOW THE USUAL PROPORTIONS REPLIED MORGAN A DIAMETER OF 
INCHES DEMANDS SIDES TWO FEET THICK AT LEAST

THAT WOULD BE MUCH TOO THICK ANSWERED BARBICANE WE DO NOT WANT A
PROJECTILE TO PIERCE ARMOURPLATE IT ONLY NEEDS SIDES STRONG ENOUGH TO
RESIST THE PRESSURE OF THE POWDERGAS THIS THEREFORE IS THE
PROBLEMWHAT THICKNESS OUGHT AN IRON OBUS TO HAVE IN ORDER TO WEIGH
ONLY  LBS OUR CLEVER CALCULATOR MR MASTON WILL TELL US AT
ONCE

NOTHING IS EASIER REPLIED THE HONOURABLE SECRETARY

SO SAYING HE TRACED SOME ALGEBRAICAL SIGNS ON THE PAPER AMONGST WHICH
N AND X FREQUENTLY APPEARED HE EVEN SEEMED TO EXTRACT FROM THEM A
CERTAIN CUBIC ROOT AND SAID

THE SIDES MUST BE HARDLY TWO INCHES THICK

WILL THAT BE SUFFICIENT ASKED THE MAJOR DOUBTFULLY

NO ANSWERED THE PRESIDENT CERTAINLY NOT

THEN WHAT MUST BE DONE RESUMED ELPHINSTONE LOOKING PUZZLED

WE MUST USE ANOTHER METAL INSTEAD OF CASTIRON

BRASS SUGGESTED MORGAN

NO THAT IS TOO HEAVY TOO AND I HAVE SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT TO
PROPOSE

WHAT ASKED THE MAJOR

ALUMINIUM ANSWERED BARBICANE

ALUMINIUM CRIED ALL THE THREE COLLEAGUES OF THE PRESIDENT

CERTAINLY MY FRIENDS YOU KNOW THAT AN ILLUSTRIOUS FRENCH CHEMIST
HENRY ST CLAIRE DEVILLE SUCCEEDED IN  IN OBTAINING ALUMINIUM IN A
COMPACT MASS THIS PRECIOUS METAL POSSESSES THE WHITENESS OF SILVER THE
INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF GOLD THE TENACITY OF IRON THE FUSIBILITY OF
COPPER THE LIGHTNESS OF GLASS IT IS EASILY WROUGHT AND IS VERY WIDELY
DISTRIBUTED IN NATURE AS ALUMINIUM FORMS THE BASIS OF MOST ROCKS IT IS
THREE TIMES LIGHTER THAN IRON AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CREATED EXPRESSLY
TO FURNISH US WITH THE MATERIAL FOR OUR PROJECTILE

HURRAH FOR ALUMINIUM CRIED THE SECRETARY ALWAYS VERY NOISY IN HIS
MOMENTS OF ENTHUSIASM

BUT MY DEAR PRESIDENT SAID THE MAJOR IS NOT ALUMINIUM QUOTED
EXCEEDINGLY HIGH

IT WAS SO ANSWERED BARBICANE WHEN FIRST DISCOVERED A POUND OF
ALUMINIUM COST  TO  DOLLARS THEN IT FELL TO TWENTYSEVEN DOLLARS
AND NOW IT IS WORTH NINE DOLLARS

BUT NINE DOLLARS A POUND REPLIED THE MAJOR WHO DID NOT EASILY GIVE
IN THAT IS STILL AN ENORMOUS PRICE

DOUBTLESS MY DEAR MAJOR BUT NOT OUT OF REACH

WHAT WILL THE PROJECTILE WEIGH THEN ASKED MORGAN

HERE IS THE RESULT OF MY CALCULATIONS ANSWERED BARBICANE A
PROJECTILE OF  INCHES IN DIAMETER AND  INCHES THICK WOULD WEIGH IF
IT WERE MADE OF CASTIRON  LBS CAST IN ALUMINIUM IT WOULD BE
REDUCED TO  LBS

PERFECT CRIED MASTON THAT SUITS OUR PROGRAMME CAPITALLY

YES REPLIED THE MAJOR BUT DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT AT NINE DOLLARS A
POUND THE PROJECTILE WOULD COST

ONE HUNDRED SEVENTYTHREE THOUSAND AND FIFTY DOLLARS YES I KNOW THAT
BUT FEAR NOTHING MY FRIENDS MONEY FOR OUR ENTERPRISE WILL NOT BE
WANTING I ANSWER FOR THAT

IT WILL BE SHOWERED UPON US REPLIED JT MASTON

WELL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO ALUMINIUM ASKED THE PRESIDENT

ADOPTED ANSWERED THE THREE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

AS TO THE FORM OF THE PROJECTILE RESUMED BARBICANE IT IS OF LITTLE
CONSEQUENCE SINCE ONCE THE ATMOSPHERE CLEARED IT WILL FIND ITSELF IN
EMPTY SPACE I THEREFORE PROPOSE A ROUND BALL WHICH WILL TURN ON
ITSELF IF IT SO PLEASES

THUS ENDED THE FIRST COMMITTEE MEETING THE QUESTION OF THE PROJECTILE
WAS DEFINITELY RESOLVED UPON AND JT MASTON WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE
IDEA OF SENDING AN ALUMINIUM BULLET TO THE SELENITES AS IT WILL GIVE
THEM NO END OF AN IDEA OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH




CHAPTER VIII

HISTORY OF THE CANNON


THE RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT THIS MEETING PRODUCED A GREAT EFFECT OUTSIDE
SOME TIMID PEOPLE GREW ALARMED AT THE IDEA OF A PROJECTILE WEIGHING
 LBS HURLED INTO SPACE PEOPLE ASKED WHAT CANNON COULD EVER
TRANSMIT AN INITIAL SPEED SUFFICIENT FOR SUCH A MASS THE REPORT OF THE
SECOND MEETING WAS DESTINED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS VICTORIOUSLY

THE NEXT EVENING THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB SAT DOWN BEFORE FRESH
MOUNTAINS OF SANDWICHES AND A VERITABLE OCEAN OF TEA THE DEBATE THEN
BEGAN

MY DEAR COLLEAGUES SAID BARBICANE WE ARE GOING TO OCCUPY OURSELVES
WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ENGINE ITS LENGTH FORM COMPOSITION AND
WEIGHT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE IT GIGANTIC
DIMENSIONS BUT HOWEVER GREAT OUR DIFFICULTIES MIGHT BE OUR INDUSTRIAL
GENIUS WILL EASILY OVERCOME THEM WILL YOU PLEASE LISTEN TO ME AND
SPARE OBJECTIONS FOR THE PRESENT I DO NOT FEAR THEM

AN APPROVING MURMUR GREETED THIS DECLARATION

WE MUST NOT FORGET RESUMED BARBICANE TO WHAT POINT OUR YESTERDAYS
DEBATE BROUGHT US THE PROBLEM IS NOW THE FOLLOWING HOW TO GIVE AN
INITIAL SPEED OF  YARDS A SECOND TO A SHOT  INCHES IN DIAMETER
WEIGHING  LBS

THAT IS THE PROBLEM INDEED ANSWERED MAJOR ELPHINSTONE

WHEN A PROJECTILE IS HURLED INTO SPACE RESUMED BARBICANE WHAT
HAPPENS IT IS ACTED UPON BY THREE INDEPENDENT FORCES THE RESISTANCE OF
THE MEDIUM THE ATTRACTION OF THE EARTH AND THE FORCE OF IMPULSION WITH
WHICH IT IS ANIMATED LET US EXAMINE THESE THREE FORCES THE RESISTANCE
OF THE MEDIUMTHAT IS TO SAY THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIRIS OF LITTLE
IMPORTANCE IN FACT THE TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERE IS ONLY FORTY MILES
DEEP WITH A RAPIDITY OF  YARDS THE PROJECTILE WILL CROSS THAT IN
FIVE SECONDS AND THIS TIME WILL BE SHORT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE RESISTANCE
OF THE MEDIUM INSIGNIFICANT LET US NOW PASS TO THE ATTRACTION OF THE
EARTHTHAT IS TO SAY TO THE WEIGHT OF THE PROJECTILE WE KNOW THAT
THAT WEIGHT DIMINISHES IN AN INVERSE RATIO TO THE SQUARE OF
DISTANCESIN FACT THIS IS WHAT PHYSICS TEACH US WHEN A BODY LEFT TO
ITSELF FALLS ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IT FALLS  FEET IN THE FIRST
SECOND AND IF THE SAME BODY HAD TO FALL  MILESTHAT IS TO SAY
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE MOONITS FALL WOULD BE REDUCED
TO HALF A LINE IN THE FIRST SECOND THAT IS ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO
IMMOBILITY THE QUESTION IS THEREFORE HOW PROGRESSIVELY TO OVERCOME
THIS LAW OF GRAVITATION HOW SHALL WE DO IT BY THE FORCE OF IMPULSION

THAT IS THE DIFFICULTY ANSWERED THE MAJOR

THAT IS IT INDEED REPLIED THE PRESIDENT BUT WE SHALL TRIUMPH OVER
IT FOR THIS FORCE OF IMPULSION WE WANT DEPENDS ON THE LENGTH OF THE
ENGINE AND THE QUANTITY OF POWDER EMPLOYED THE ONE ONLY BEING LIMITED
BY THE RESISTANCE OF THE OTHER LET US OCCUPY OURSELVES THEREFORE
TODAY WITH THE DIMENSIONS TO BE GIVEN TO THE CANNON IT IS QUITE
UNDERSTOOD THAT WE CAN MAKE IT AS LARGE AS WE LIKE SEEING IT WILL NOT
HAVE TO BE MOVED

ALL THAT IS EVIDENT REPLIED THE GENERAL

UNTIL NOW SAID BARBICANE THE LONGEST CANNON OUR ENORMOUS
COLUMBIADS HAVE NOT BEEN MORE THAN TWENTYFIVE FEET LONG WE SHALL
THEREFORE ASTONISH MANY PEOPLE BY THE DIMENSIONS WE SHALL HAVE TO
ADOPT

CERTAINLY EXCLAIMED JT MASTON FOR MY PART I ASK FOR A CANNON
HALF A MILE LONG AT LEAST

HALF A MILE CRIED THE MAJOR AND THE GENERAL

YES HALF A MILE AND THAT WILL BE HALF TOO SHORT

COME MASTON ANSWERED MORGAN YOU EXAGGERATE

NO I DO NOT SAID THE IRATE SECRETARY AND I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHY
YOU TAX ME WITH EXAGGERATION

BECAUSE YOU GO TOO FAR

YOU MUST KNOW SIR ANSWERED JT MASTON LOOKING DIGNIFIED THAT AN
ARTILLERYMAN IS LIKE A CANNONBALL HE CAN NEVER GO TOO FAR

THE DEBATE WAS GETTING PERSONAL BUT THE PRESIDENT INTERFERED

BE CALM MY FRIENDS AND LET US REASON IT OUT WE EVIDENTLY WANT A GUN
OF GREAT RANGE AS THE LENGTH OF THE ENGINE WILL INCREASE THE DETENTION
OF GAS ACCUMULATED BEHIND THE PROJECTILE BUT IT IS USELESS TO OVERSTEP
CERTAIN LIMITS

PERFECTLY SAID THE MAJOR

WHAT ARE THE USUAL RULES IN SUCH A CASE ORDINARILY THE LENGTH OF A
CANNON IS TWENTY OR TWENTYFIVE TIMES THE DIAMETER OF THE PROJECTILE
AND IT WEIGHS  TO  TIMES ITS WEIGHT

IT IS NOT ENOUGH CRIED JT MASTON WITH IMPETUOSITY

I AGREE TO THAT MY WORTHY FRIEND AND IN FACT BY KEEPING THAT
PROPORTION FOR A PROJECTILE NINE FEET WIDE WEIGHING  LBS THE
ENGINE WOULD ONLY HAVE A LENGTH OF  FEET AND A WEIGHT OF 
LBS

THAT IS RIDICULOUS RESUMED JT MASTON YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE A
PISTOL

I THINK SO TOO ANSWERED BARBICANE THAT IS WHY I PROPOSE TO
QUADRUPLE THAT LENGTH AND TO CONSTRUCT A CANNON  FEET LONG

THE GENERAL AND THE MAJOR MADE SOME OBJECTIONS BUT NEVERTHELESS THIS
PROPOSITION STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE SECRETARY WAS DEFINITELY
ADOPTED

NOW SAID ELPHINSTONE WHAT THICKNESS MUST WE GIVE ITS SIDES

A THICKNESS OF SIX FEET ANSWERED BARBICANE

YOU DO NOT THINK OF RAISING SUCH A MASS UPON A GUNCARRIAGE ASKED THE
MAJOR

THAT WOULD BE SUPERB HOWEVER SAID JT MASTON

BUT IMPRACTICABLE ANSWERED BARBICANE NO I THINK OF CASTING THIS
ENGINE IN THE GROUND ITSELF BINDING IT UP WITH WROUGHTIRON HOOPS AND
THEN SURROUNDING IT WITH A THICK MASS OF STONE AND CEMENT MASONRY WHEN
IT IS CAST IT MUST BE BORED WITH GREAT PRECISION SO AS TO PREVENT
WINDAGE SO THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OF GAS AND ALL THE EXPANSIVE FORCE OF
THE POWDER WILL BE EMPLOYED IN THE PROPULSION

HURRAH HURRAH SAID MASTON WE HAVE OUR CANNON

NOT YET ANSWERED BARBICANE CALMING HIS IMPATIENT FRIEND WITH HIS
HAND

WHY NOT

BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT DISCUSSED ITS FORM SHALL IT BE A CANNON HOWITZER
OR A MORTAR

A CANNON REPLIED MORGAN

A HOWITZER SAID THE MAJOR

A MORTAR EXCLAIMED JT MASTON

A FRESH DISCUSSION WAS PENDING EACH TAKING THE PART OF HIS FAVOURITE
WEAPON WHEN THE PRESIDENT STOPPED IT SHORT

MY FRIENDS SAID HE I WILL SOON MAKE YOU AGREE OUR COLUMBIAD WILL
BE A MIXTURE OF ALL THREE IT WILL BE A CANNON BECAUSE THE
POWDERMAGAZINE WILL HAVE THE SAME DIAMETER AS THE CHAMBER IT WILL BE A
HOWITZER BECAUSE IT WILL HURL AN OBUS LASTLY IT WILL BE A MORTAR
BECAUSE IT WILL BE POINTED AT AN ANGLE OF DEG AND THAT WITHOUT ANY
CHANCE OF RECOIL UNALTERABLY FIXED TO THE GROUND IT WILL COMMUNICATE
TO THE PROJECTILE ALL THE POWER OF IMPULSION ACCUMULATED IN ITS BODY

ADOPTED ADOPTED ANSWERED THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

ONE QUESTION SAID ELPHINSTONE AND WILL THIS CANOBUSOMORTAR BE
RIFLED

NO ANSWERED BARBICANE NO WE MUST HAVE AN ENORMOUS INITIAL SPEED
AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT A SHOT LEAVES A RIFLE LESS RAPIDLY THAN A
SMOOTHBORE

TRUE ANSWERED THE MAJOR

WELL WE HAVE IT THIS TIME REPEATED JT MASTON

NOT QUITE YET REPLIED THE PRESIDENT

WHY NOT

BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET KNOW OF WHAT METAL IT WILL BE MADE

LET US DECIDE THAT WITHOUT DELAY

I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE IT TO YOU

THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE EACH SWALLOWED A DOZEN SANDWICHES
FOLLOWED BY A CUP OF TEA AND THE DEBATE RECOMMENCED

OUR CANNON SAID BARBICANE MUST BE POSSESSED OF GREAT TENACITY
GREAT HARDNESS IT MUST BE INFUSIBLE BY HEAT INDISSOLUBLE AND
INOXYDABLE BY THE CORROSIVE ACTION OF ACIDS

THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT ANSWERED THE MAJOR AND AS WE SHALL
HAVE TO EMPLOY A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF METAL WE SHALL NOT HAVE MUCH
CHOICE

WELL THEN SAID MORGAN I PROPOSE FOR THE FABRICATION OF THE
COLUMBIAD THE BEST ALLOY HITHERTO KNOWNTHAT IS TO SAY  PARTS OF
COPPER  OF TIN AND  OF BRASS

MY FRIENDS ANSWERED THE PRESIDENT I AGREE THAT THIS COMPOSITION HAS
GIVEN EXCELLENT RESULTS BUT IN BULK IT WOULD BE TOO DEAR AND VERY HARD
TO WORK I THEREFORE THINK WE MUST ADOPT AN EXCELLENT MATERIAL BUT
CHEAP SUCH AS CASTIRON IS NOT THAT YOUR OPINION MAJOR

QUITE ANSWERED ELPHINSTONE

IN FACT RESUMED BARBICANE CASTIRON COSTS TEN TIMES LESS THAN
BRONZE IT IS EASILY MELTED IT IS READILY RUN INTO SAND MOULDS AND IS
RAPIDLY MANIPULATED IT IS THEREFORE AN ECONOMY OF MONEY AND TIME
BESIDES THAT MATERIAL IS EXCELLENT AND I REMEMBER THAT DURING THE WAR
AT THE SIEGE OF ATLANTA CASTIRON CANNON FIRED A THOUSAND SHOTS EACH
EVERY TWENTY MINUTES WITHOUT BEING DAMAGED BY IT

YET CASTIRON IS VERY BRITTLE ANSWERED MORGAN

YES BUT IT POSSESSES RESISTANCE TOO BESIDES WE SHALL NOT LET IT
EXPLODE I CAN ANSWER FOR THAT

IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPLODE AND YET BE HONEST REPLIED JT MASTON
SENTENTIOUSLY

EVIDENTLY ANSWERED BARBICANE I AM THEREFORE GOING TO BEG OUR
WORTHY SECRETARY TO CALCULATE THE WEIGHT OF A CASTIRON CANNON  FEET
LONG WITH AN INNER DIAMETER OF NINE FEET AND SIDES SIX FEET THICK

AT ONCE ANSWERED JT MASTON AND AS HE HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE HE
MADE HIS CALCULATIONS WITH MARVELLOUS FACILITY AND SAID AT THE END OF A
MINUTE

THIS CANNON WILL WEIGH  TONS

AND HOW MUCH WILL THAT COST AT TWO CENTS A POUND

TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND ONE
DOLLARS

JT MASTON THE MAJOR AND THE GENERAL LOOKED AT BARBICANE ANXIOUSLY

WELL GENTLEMEN SAID THE PRESIDENT I CAN ONLY REPEAT WHAT I SAID TO
YOU YESTERDAY DONT BE UNEASY WE SHALL NOT WANT FOR MONEY

UPON THIS ASSURANCE OF ITS PRESIDENT THE COMMITTEE BROKE UP AFTER
HAVING FIXED A THIRD MEETING FOR THE NEXT EVENING




CHAPTER IX

THE QUESTION OF POWDERS


THE QUESTION OF POWDER STILL REMAINED TO BE SETTLED THE PUBLIC AWAITED
THIS LAST DECISION WITH ANXIETY THE SIZE OF THE PROJECTILE AND LENGTH
OF THE CANNON BEING GIVEN WHAT WOULD BE THE QUANTITY OF POWDER
NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THE IMPULSION THIS TERRIBLE AGENT OF WHICH
HOWEVER MAN HAS MADE HIMSELF MASTER WAS DESTINED TO PLAY A PART IN
UNUSUAL PROPORTIONS

IT IS GENERALLY KNOWN AND OFTEN ASSERTED THAT GUNPOWDER WAS INVENTED IN
THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY BY THE MONK SCHWARTZ WHO PAID FOR HIS GREAT
DISCOVERY WITH HIS LIFE BUT IT IS NEARLY PROVED NOW THAT THIS STORY
MUST BE RANKED AMONG THE LEGENDS OF THE MIDDLE AGES GUNPOWDER WAS
INVENTED BY NO ONE IT IS A DIRECT PRODUCT OF GREEK FIRE COMPOSED LIKE
IT OF SULPHUR AND SALTPETRE ONLY SINCE THAT EPOCH THESE MIXTURES
WHICH WERE ONLY DISSOLVING HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO DETONATING
MIXTURES

BUT IF LEARNED MEN KNOW PERFECTLY THE FALSE HISTORY OF GUNPOWDER FEW
PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF ITS MECHANICAL POWER NOW THIS IS NECESSARY TO BE
KNOWN IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE QUESTION SUBMITTED TO
THE COMMITTEE

THUS A LITRE OF GUNPOWDER WEIGHS ABOUT  LBS IT PRODUCES BY BURNING
ABOUT  LITRES OF GAS THIS GAS LIBERATED AND UNDER THE ACTION OF A
TEMPERATURE OF DEG OCCUPIES THE SPACE OF  LITRES THEREFORE THE
VOLUME OF POWDER IS TO THE VOLUME OF GAS PRODUCED BY ITS DEFLAGRATION AS
 TO  THE FRIGHTFUL FORCE OF THIS GAS WHEN IT IS COMPRESSED INTO A
SPACE  TIMES TOO SMALL MAY BE IMAGINED

THIS IS WHAT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KNEW PERFECTLY WHEN THE NEXT
DAY THEY BEGAN THEIR SITTING MAJOR ELPHINSTONE OPENED THE DEBATE

MY DEAR COMRADES SAID THE DISTINGUISHED CHEMIST I AM GOING TO BEGIN
WITH SOME UNEXCEPTIONABLE FIGURES WHICH WILL SERVE AS A BASIS FOR OUR
CALCULATION THE LB CANNONBALL OF WHICH THE HON JT MASTON SPOKE
THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY IS DRIVEN OUT OF THE CANNON BY  LBS OF
POWDER ONLY

YOU ARE CERTAIN OF YOUR FIGURES ASKED BARBICANE

ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN ANSWERED THE MAJOR THE ARMSTRONG CANNON ONLY
USES  LBS OF POWDER FOR A PROJECTILE OF  LBS AND THE RODMAN
COLUMBIAD ONLY EXPENDS  LBS OF POWDER TO SEND ITS HALFTON BULLET
SIX MILES THESE FACTS CANNOT BE DOUBTED FOR I FOUND THEM MYSELF IN THE
REPORTS OF THE COMMITTEE OF ARTILLERY

THAT IS CERTAIN ANSWERED THE GENERAL

WELL RESUMED THE MAJOR THE CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN FROM THESE
FIGURES IS THAT THE QUANTITY OF POWDER DOES NOT AUGMENT WITH THE WEIGHT
OF THE SHOT IN FACT IF A SHOT OF  LBS TOOK  LBS OF POWDER AND
IN OTHER TERMS IF IN ORDINARY CANNONS A QUANTITY OF POWDER WEIGHING
TWOTHIRDS OF THE WEIGHT OF THE PROJECTILE IS USED THIS PROPORTION IS
NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY CALCULATE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT FOR THE SHOT OF
HALF A TON WEIGHT INSTEAD OF  LBS OF POWDER THIS QUANTITY HAS BEEN
REDUCED TO  LBS ONLY

WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT ASKED THE PRESIDENT

THE EXTREME OF YOUR THEORY MY DEAR MAJOR SAID JT MASTON WOULD
BRING YOU TO HAVING NO POWDER AT ALL PROVIDED YOUR SHOT WERE
SUFFICIENTLY HEAVY

FRIEND MASTON WILL HAVE HIS JOKE EVEN IN THE MOST SERIOUS THINGS
REPLIED THE MAJOR BUT HE NEED NOT BE UNEASY I SHALL SOON PROPOSE A
QUANTITY OF POWDER THAT WILL SATISFY HIM ONLY I WISH TO HAVE IT
UNDERSTOOD THAT DURING THE WAR AND FOR THE LARGEST GUNS THE WEIGHT OF
THE POWDER WAS REDUCED AFTER EXPERIENCE TO A TENTH OF THE WEIGHT OF
THE SHOT

NOTHING IS MORE EXACT SAID MORGAN BUT BEFORE DECIDING THE QUANTITY
OF POWDER NECESSARY TO GIVE THE IMPULSION I THINK IT WOULD BE WELL TO
AGREE UPON ITS NATURE

WE SHALL USE A LARGEGRAINED POWDER ANSWERED THE MAJOR ITS
DEFLAGRATION IS THE MOST RAPID

NO DOUBT REPLIED MORGAN BUT IT IS VERY BRITTLE AND ENDS BY
DAMAGING THE CHAMBER OF THE GUN

CERTAINLY BUT WHAT WOULD BE BAD FOR A GUN DESTINED FOR LONG SERVICE
WOULD NOT BE SO FOR OUR COLUMBIAD WE RUN NO DANGER OF EXPLOSION AND
THE POWDER MUST IMMEDIATELY TAKE FIRE TO MAKE ITS MECHANICAL EFFECT
COMPLETE

WE MIGHT MAKE SEVERAL TOUCHHOLES SAID JT MASTON SO AS TO SET FIRE
TO IT IN SEVERAL PLACES AT THE SAME TIME

NO DOUBT ANSWERED ELPHINSTONE BUT THAT WOULD MAKE THE WORKING OF IT
MORE DIFFICULT I THEREFORE COME BACK TO MY LARGEGRAINED POWDER THAT
REMOVES THESE DIFFICULTIES

SO BE IT ANSWERED THE GENERAL

TO LOAD HIS COLUMBIAD RESUMED THE MAJOR RODMAN USED A POWDER IN
GRAINS AS LARGE AS CHESTNUTS MADE OF WILLOW CHARCOAL SIMPLY RAREFIED
IN CASTIRON PANS THIS POWDER WAS HARD AND SHINING LEFT NO STAIN ON
THE HANDS CONTAINED A GREAT PROPORTION OF HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN
DEFLAGRATED INSTANTANEOUSLY AND THOUGH VERY BRITTLE DID NOT MUCH
DAMAGE THE MOUTHPIECE

WELL IT SEEMS TO ME ANSWERED JT MASTON THAT WE HAVE NOTHING TO
HESITATE ABOUT AND THAT OUR CHOICE IS MADE

UNLESS YOU PREFER GOLDPOWDER REPLIED THE MAJOR LAUGHING WHICH
PROVOKED A THREATENING GESTURE FROM THE STEEL HOOK OF HIS SUSCEPTIBLE
FRIEND

UNTIL THEN BARBICANE HAD KEPT HIMSELF ALOOF FROM THE DISCUSSION HE
LISTENED AND HAD EVIDENTLY AN IDEA HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING
SIMPLY

NOW MY FRIENDS WHAT QUANTITY OF POWDER DO YOU PROPOSE

THE THREE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER FOR THE SPACE OF
A MINUTE

TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS SAID MORGAN AT LAST

FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND REPLIED THE MAJOR

EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND EXCLAIMED JT MASTON

THIS TIME ELPHINSTONE DARED NOT TAX HIS COLLEAGUE WITH EXAGGERATION IN
FACT THE QUESTION WAS THAT OF SENDING TO THE MOON A PROJECTILE WEIGHING
 LBS AND OF GIVING IT AN INITIAL FORCE OF  YARDS A SECOND A
MOMENT OF SILENCE THEREFORE FOLLOWED THE TRIPLE PROPOSITION MADE BY
THE THREE COLLEAGUES

IT WAS AT LAST BROKEN BY PRESIDENT BARBICANE

MY BRAVE COMRADES SAID HE IN A QUIET TONE I START FROM THIS
PRINCIPLE THAT THE RESISTANCE OF OUR CANNON IN THE GIVEN CONDITIONS
IS UNLIMITED I SHALL THEREFORE SURPRISE THE HONOURABLE JT MASTON
WHEN I TELL HIM THAT HE HAS BEEN TIMID IN HIS CALCULATIONS AND I
PROPOSE TO DOUBLE HIS  LBS OF POWDER

SIXTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS SHOUTED JT MASTON JUMPING OUT OF
HIS CHAIR

QUITE AS MUCH AS THAT

THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO COME BACK TO MY CANNON HALF A MILE LONG

IT IS EVIDENT SAID THE MAJOR

SIXTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS OF POWDER RESUMED THE SECRETARY OF
COMMITTEE WILL OCCUPY ABOUT A SPACE OF  CUBIC FEET NOW AS YOUR
CANNON WILL ONLY HOLD ABOUT  CUBIC FEET IT WILL BE HALF FULL AND
THE CHAMBER WILL NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE EXPLOSION OF THE GAS TO
GIVE SUFFICIENT IMPULSION TO YOUR PROJECTILE

THERE WAS NOTHING TO ANSWER JT MASTON SPOKE THE TRUTH THEY ALL
LOOKED AT BARBICANE

HOWEVER RESUMED THE PRESIDENT I HOLD TO THAT QUANTITY OF POWDER
THINK  POUNDS OF POWDER WILL GIVE  LITRES OF
GAS

THEN HOW IS IT TO BE DONE ASKED THE GENERAL

IT IS VERY SIMPLE WE MUST REDUCE THIS ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF POWDER
KEEPING AT THE SAME TIME ITS MECHANICAL POWER

GOOD BY WHAT MEANS

I WILL TELL YOU ANSWERED BARBICANE SIMPLY

HIS INTERLOCUTORS ALL LOOKED AT HIM

NOTHING IS EASIER IN FACT HE RESUMED THAN TO BRING THAT MASS OF
POWDER TO A VOLUME FOUR TIMES LESS YOU ALL KNOW THAT CURIOUS CELLULAR
MATTER WHICH CONSTITUTES THE ELEMENTARY TISSUES OF VEGETABLES

AH SAID THE MAJOR I UNDERSTAND YOU BARBICANE

THIS MATTER SAID THE PRESIDENT IS OBTAINED IN PERFECT PURITY IN
DIFFERENT THINGS ESPECIALLY IN COTTON WHICH IS NOTHING BUT THE SKIN OF
THE SEEDS OF THE COTTON PLANT NOW COTTON COMBINED WITH COLD NITRIC
ACID IS TRANSFORMED INTO A SUBSTANCE EMINENTLY INSOLUBLE EMINENTLY
COMBUSTIBLE EMINENTLY EXPLOSIVE SOME YEARS AGO IN  A FRENCH
CHEMIST BRACONNOT DISCOVERED THIS SUBSTANCE WHICH HE CALLED
XYLOIDINE IN  ANOTHER FRENCHMAN PELOUZE STUDIED ITS DIFFERENT
PROPERTIES AND LASTLY IN  SCHONBEIN PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AT
BASLE PROPOSED IT AS GUNPOWDER THIS POWDER IS NITRIC COTTON

OR PYROXYLE ANSWERED ELPHINSTONE

OR FULMINATING COTTON REPLIED MORGAN

IS THERE NOT AN AMERICAN NAME TO PUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS DISCOVERY
EXCLAIMED JT MASTON ANIMATED BY A LIVELY SENTIMENT OF PATRIOTISM

NOT ONE UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED THE MAJOR

NEVERTHELESS TO SATISFY MASTON RESUMED THE PRESIDENT I MAY TELL
HIM THAT ONE OF OUR FELLOWCITIZENS MAY BE ANNEXED TO THE STUDY OF THE
CELLUOSITY FOR COLLODION WHICH IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN
PHOTOGRAPHY IS SIMPLY PYROXYLE DISSOLVED IN ETHER TO WHICH ALCOHOL HAS
BEEN ADDED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED BY MAYNARD THEN A MEDICAL STUDENT

HURRAH FOR MAYNARD AND FULMINATING COTTON CRIED THE NOISY SECRETARY
OF THE GUN CLUB

I RETURN TO PYROXYLE RESUMED BARBICANE YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH ITS
PROPERTIES WHICH MAKE IT SO PRECIOUS TO US IT IS PREPARED WITH THE
GREATEST FACILITY COTTON PLUNGED IN SMOKING NITRIC ACID FOR FIFTEEN
MINUTES THEN WASHED IN WATER THEN DRIED AND THAT IS ALL

NOTHING IS MORE SIMPLE CERTAINTY SAID MORGAN

WHAT IS MORE PYROXYLE IS NOT DAMAGED BY MOISTURE A PRECIOUS QUALITY
IN OUR EYES AS IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL DAYS TO LOAD THE CANNON ITS
INFLAMMABILITY TAKES PLACE AT DEG INSTEAD OF AT DEG AND ITS
DEFLAGRATION IS SO IMMEDIATE THAT IT MAY BE FIRED ON ORDINARY GUNPOWDER
BEFORE THE LATTER HAS TIME TO CATCH FIRE TOO

PERFECT ANSWERED THE MAJOR

ONLY IT WILL COST MORE

WHAT DOES THAT MATTER SAID JT MASTON

LASTLY IT COMMUNICATES TO PROJECTILES A SPEED FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN
THAT OF GUNPOWDER I MAY EVEN ADD THAT IF THS OF ITS WEIGHT OF
NITRATE OF POTASH IS ADDED ITS EXPANSIVE FORCE IS STILL GREATLY
AUGMENTED

WILL THAT BE NECESSARY ASKED THE MAJOR

I DO NOT THINK SO ANSWERED BARBICANE THUS INSTEAD OF  LBS
OF POWDER WE SHALL ONLY HAVE  LBS OF FULMINATING COTTON AND AS
WE CAN WITHOUT DANGER COMPRESS  LBS OF COTTON INTO  CUBIC FEET
THAT QUANTITY WILL NOT TAKE UP MORE THAN  FEET IN THE CHAMBER OF THE
COLUMBIAD BY THESE MEANS THE PROJECTILE WILL HAVE MORE THAN  FEET OF
CHAMBER TO TRAVERSE UNDER A FORCE OF  OF LITRES OF GAS
BEFORE TAKING ITS FLIGHT OVER THE QUEEN OF NIGHT

HERE JT MASTON COULD NOT CONTAIN HIS EMOTION HE THREW HIMSELF INTO
THE ARMS OF HIS FRIEND WITH THE VIOLENCE OF A PROJECTILE AND HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN STOVE IN HAD HE NOT HAVE BEEN BOMBPROOF

THIS INCIDENT ENDED THE FIRST SITTING OF THE COMMITTEE BARBICANE AND
HIS ENTERPRISING COLLEAGUES TO WHOM NOTHING SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE HAD JUST
SOLVED THE COMPLEX QUESTION OF THE PROJECTILE CANNON AND POWDER THEIR
PLAN BEING MADE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT TO PUT IT INTO EXECUTION




CHAPTER X

ONE ENEMY AGAINST TWENTYFIVE MILLIONS OF FRIENDS


THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN THE LEAST DETAILS OF THE GUN
CLUBS ENTERPRISE IT FOLLOWED THE COMMITTEE DEBATES DAY BY DAY THE
MOST SIMPLE PREPARATIONS FOR THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT THE QUESTIONS OF
FIGURES IT PROVOKED THE MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES TO BE SOLVED ALL
EXCITED POPULAR OPINION TO THE HIGHEST PITCH

MORE THAN A YEAR WOULD ELAPSE BETWEEN THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WORK AND
ITS COMPLETION BUT THE INTERVAL WOULD NOT BE VOID OF EXCITEMENT THE
PLACE TO BE CHOSEN FOR THE BORING THE CASTING THE METAL OF THE
COLUMBIAD ITS PERILOUS LOADING ALL THIS WAS MORE THAN NECESSARY TO
EXCITE PUBLIC CURIOSITY THE PROJECTILE ONCE FIRED WOULD BE OUT OF
SIGHT IN A FEW SECONDS THEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF IT HOW IT WOULD
BEHAVE IN SPACE HOW IT WOULD REACH THE MOON NONE BUT A FEW PRIVILEGED
PERSONS WOULD SEE WITH THEIR OWN EYES THUS THEN THE PREPARATIONS FOR
THE EXPERIMENT AND THE PRECISE DETAILS OF ITS EXECUTION CONSTITUTED THE
REAL SOURCE OF INTEREST

IN THE MEANTIME THE PURELY SCIENTIFIC ATTRACTION OF THE ENTERPRISE WAS
ALL AT ONCE HEIGHTENED BY AN INCIDENT

IT IS KNOWN WHAT NUMEROUS LEGIONS OF ADMIRERS AND FRIENDS THE BARBICANE
PROJECT HAD CALLED ROUND ITS AUTHOR BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE NUMBER AND
IMPORTANCE OF THE MAJORITY IT WAS NOT DESTINED TO BE UNANIMOUS ONE
MAN ONE OUT OF ALL THE UNITED STATES PROTESTED AGAINST THE GUN CLUB
HE ATTACKED IT VIOLENTLY ON EVERY OCCASION ANDFOR HUMAN NATURE IS
THUS CONSTITUTEDBARBICANE WAS MORE SENSITIVE TO THIS ONE MANS
OPPOSITION THAN TO THE APPLAUSE OF ALL THE OTHERS

NEVERTHELESS HE WELL KNEW THE MOTIVE OF THIS ANTIPATHY FROM WHENCE CAME
THIS SOLITARY ENMITY WHY IT WAS PERSONAL AND OF ANCIENT DATE LASTLY
IN WHAT RIVALRY IT HAD TAKEN ROOT

THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAD NEVER SEEN THIS PERSEVERING ENEMY
HAPPILY FOR THE MEETING OF THE TWO MEN WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HAD
DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES THIS RIVAL WAS A SAVANT LIKE BARBICANE A
PROUD ENTERPRISING DETERMINED AND VIOLENT CHARACTER A PURE YANKEE
HIS NAME WAS CAPTAIN NICHOLL HE LIVED IN PHILADELPHIA

NO ONE IS IGNORANT OF THE CURIOUS STRUGGLE WHICH WENT ON DURING THE
FEDERAL WAR BETWEEN THE PROJECTILE AND IRONCLAD VESSELS THE FORMER
DESTINED TO PIERCE THE LATTER THE LATTER DETERMINED NOT TO BE PIERCED
THENCE CAME A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE NAVIES OF THE TWO
CONTINENTS CANNONBALLS AND IRON PLATES STRUGGLED FOR SUPREMACY THE
FORMER GETTING LARGER AS THE LATTER GOT THICKER SHIPS ARMED WITH
FORMIDABLE GUNS WENT INTO THE FIRE UNDER SHELTER OF THEIR INVULNERABLE
ARMOUR THE MERRIMAC MONITOR RAM TENNESSEE AND WECHHAUSEN SHOT
ENORMOUS PROJECTILES AFTER HAVING MADE THEMSELVES PROOF AGAINST THE
PROJECTILES OF OTHER SHIPS THEY DID TO OTHERS WHAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE
OTHERS DO TO THEM AN IMMORAL PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THE WHOLE ART OF WAR
IS BASED

NOW BARBICANE WAS A GREAT CASTER OF PROJECTILES AND NICHOLL WAS AN
EQUALLY GREAT FORGER OF PLATEARMOUR THE ONE CAST NIGHT AND DAY AT
BALTIMORE THE OTHER FORGED DAY AND NIGHT AT PHILADELPHIA EACH FOLLOWED
AN ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT CURRENT OF IDEAS

AS SOON AS BARBICANE HAD INVENTED A NEW PROJECTILE NICHOLL INVENTED A
NEW PLATE ARMOUR THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB PASSED HIS LIFE IN
PIERCING HOLES THE CAPTAIN IN PREVENTING HIM DOING IT HENCE A CONSTANT
RIVALRY WHICH EVEN TOUCHED THEIR PERSONS NICHOLL APPEARED IN
BARBICANES DREAMS AS AN IMPENETRABLE IRONCLAD AGAINST WHICH HE SPLIT
AND BARBICANE IN NICHOLLS DREAMS APPEARED LIKE A PROJECTILE WHICH
RIPPED HIM UP

STILL ALTHOUGH THEY RAN ALONG TWO DIVERGING LINES THESE SAVANTS
WOULD HAVE ENDED BY MEETING EACH OTHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE AXIOMS IN
GEOMETRY BUT THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON A DUEL FIELD HAPPILY FOR THESE
WORTHY CITIZENS SO USEFUL TO THEIR COUNTRY A DISTANCE OF FROM FIFTY TO
SIXTY MILES SEPARATED THEM AND THEIR FRIENDS PUT SUCH OBSTACLES IN THE
WAY THAT THEY NEVER MET

AT PRESENT IT WAS NOT CLEARLY KNOWN WHICH OF THE TWO INVENTORS HELD THE
PALM THE RESULTS OBTAINED RENDERED A JUST DECISION DIFFICULT IT
SEEMED HOWEVER THAT IN THE END ARMOURPLATE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE WAY TO
PROJECTILES NEVERTHELESS COMPETENT MEN HAD THEIR DOUBTS AT THE LATEST
EXPERIMENTS THE CYLINDROCONICAL SHOTS OF BARBICANE HAD NO MORE EFFECT
THAN PINS UPON NICHOLLS ARMOURPLATE THAT DAY THE FORGER OF
PHILADELPHIA BELIEVED HIMSELF VICTORIOUS AND HENCEFORTH HAD NOTHING BUT
DISDAIN FOR HIS RIVAL BUT WHEN LATER ON BARBICANE SUBSTITUTED SIMPLE
HOWITZERS OF  LBS FOR CONICAL SHOTS THE CAPTAIN WAS OBLIGED TO GO
DOWN IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION IT FACT THESE PROJECTILES THOUGH OF
MEDIOCRE VELOCITY DRILLED WITH HOLES AND BROKE TO PIECES ARMOURPLATE
OF THE BEST METAL

THINGS HAD REACHED THIS POINT AND VICTORY SEEMED TO REST WITH THE
PROJECTILE WHEN THE WAR ENDED THE VERY DAY THAT NICHOLL TERMINATED A
NEW FORGED ARMOURPLATE IT WAS A MASTERPIECE OF ITS KIND IT DEFIED ALL
THE PROJECTILES IN THE WORLD THE CAPTAIN HAD IT TAKEN TO THE WASHINGTON
POLYGON AND CHALLENGED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB TO PIERCE IT
BARBICANE PEACE HAVING BEEN MADE WOULD NOT ATTEMPT THE EXPERIMENT

THEN NICHOLL IN A RAGE OFFERED TO EXPOSE HIS ARMOURPLATE TO THE SHOCK
OF ANY KIND OF PROJECTILE SOLID HOLLOW ROUND OR CONICAL

THE PRESIDENT WHO WAS DETERMINED NOT TO COMPROMISE HIS LAST SUCCESS
REFUSED

NICHOLL EXCITED BY THIS UNQUALIFIED OBSTINACY TRIED TO TEMPT BARBICANE
BY LEAVING HIM EVERY ADVANTAGE HE PROPOSED TO PUT HIS PLATE  YARDS
FROM THE GUN BARBICANE STILL REFUSED AT  YARDS NOT EVEN AT 

AT  THEN CRIED THE CAPTAIN THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS AT  YARDS
FROM MY PLATE AND I WILL BE BEHIND IT

BARBICANE ANSWERED THAT EVEN IF CAPTAIN NICHOLL WOULD BE IN FRONT OF IT
HE WOULD NOT FIRE ANY MORE

ON THIS REPLY NICHOLL COULD NO LONGER CONTAIN HIMSELF HE HAD RECOURSE
TO PERSONALITIES HE INSINUATED COWARDICETHAT THE MAN WHO REFUSES TO
FIRE A SHOT FROM A CANNON IS VERY NEARLY BEING AFRAID OF IT THAT IN
SHORT THE ARTILLERYMEN WHO FIGHT NOW AT SIX MILES DISTANCE HAVE
PRUDENTLY SUBSTITUTED MATHEMATICAL FORMULAE FOR INDIVIDUAL COURAGE AND
THAT THERE IS AS MUCH BRAVERY REQUIRED TO QUIETLY WAIT FOR A CANNONBALL
BEHIND ARMOURPLATE AS TO SEND IT ACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES OF SCIENCE

TO THESE INSINUATIONS BARBICANE ANSWERED NOTHING PERHAPS HE NEVER KNEW
ABOUT THEM FOR THE CALCULATIONS OF HIS GREAT ENTERPRISE ABSORBED HIM
ENTIRELY

WHEN HE MADE HIS FAMOUS COMMUNICATION TO THE GUN CLUB THE ANGER OF
CAPTAIN NICHOLL REACHED ITS MAXIMUM MIXED WITH IT WAS SUPREME JEALOUSY
AND A SENTIMENT OF ABSOLUTE POWERLESSNESS HOW COULD HE INVENT ANYTHING
BETTER THAN A COLUMBIAD  FEET LONG WHAT ARMOURPLATE COULD EVER
RESIST A PROJECTILE OF  LBS NICHOLL WAS AT FIRST CRUSHED BY THIS
CANNONBALL THEN HE RECOVERED AND RESOLVED TO CRUSH THE PROPOSITION BY
THE WEIGHT OF HIS BEST ARGUMENTS

HE THEREFORE VIOLENTLY ATTACKED THE LABOURS OF THE GUN CLUB HE SENT A
NUMBER OF LETTERS TO THE NEWSPAPERS WHICH THEY DID NOT REFUSE TO
PUBLISH HE TRIED TO DEMOLISH BARBICANES WORK SCIENTIFICALLY ONCE THE
WAR BEGUN HE CALLED REASONS OF EVERY KIND TO HIS AID REASONS IT MUST
BE ACKNOWLEDGED OFTEN SPECIOUS AND OF BAD METAL

FIRSTLY BARBICANE WAS VIOLENTLY ATTACKED ABOUT HIS FIGURES NICHOLL
TRIED TO PROVE BY A  B THE FALSENESS OF HIS FORMULAE AND HE ACCUSED
HIM OF BEING IGNORANT OF THE RUDIMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BALLISTICS
AMONGST OTHER ERRORS AND ACCORDING TO NICHOLLS OWN CALCULATIONS IT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE ANY BODY A VELOCITY OF  YARDS A SECOND HE
SUSTAINED ALGEBRA IN HAND THAT EVEN WITH THAT VELOCITY A PROJECTILE
THUS HEAVY WOULD NEVER PASS THE LIMITS OF THE TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERE IT
WOULD NOT EVEN GO EIGHT LEAGUES BETTER STILL GRANTED THE VELOCITY AND
TAKING IT AS SUFFICIENT THE SHOT WOULD NOT RESIST THE PRESSURE OF THE
GAS DEVELOPED BY THE COMBUSTION OF  POUNDS OF POWDER AND EVEN
IF IT DID RESIST THAT PRESSURE IT AT LEAST WOULD NOT SUPPORT SUCH A
TEMPERATURE IT WOULD MELT AS IT ISSUED FROM THE COLUMBIAD AND WOULD
FALL IN REDHOT RAIN ON THE HEADS OF THE IMPRUDENT SPECTATORS

BARBICANE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THESE ATTACKS AND WENT ON WITH HIS WORK

THEN NICHOLL CONSIDERED THE QUESTION IN ITS OTHER ASPECTS WITHOUT
SPEAKING OF ITS USELESSNESS FROM ALL OTHER POINTS OF VIEW HE LOOKED
UPON THE EXPERIMENT AS EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS BOTH FOR THE CITIZENS WHO
AUTHORISED SO CONDEMNABLE A SPECTACLE BY THEIR PRESENCE AND FOR THE
TOWNS NEAR THE DEPLORABLE CANNON HE ALSO REMARKED THAT IF THE
PROJECTILE DID NOT REACH ITS DESTINATION A RESULT ABSOLUTELY
IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IT WOULD FALL ON TO THE EARTH AGAIN AND
THAT THE FALL OF SUCH A MASS MULTIPLIED BY THE SQUARE OF ITS VELOCITY
WOULD SINGULARLY DAMAGE SOME POINT ON THE GLOBE THEREFORE IN SUCH A
CIRCUMSTANCE AND WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION BEING PUT UPON THE RIGHTS OF
FREE CITIZENS IT WAS ONE OF THOSE CASES IN WHICH THE INTERVENTION OF
GOVERNMENT BECAME NECESSARY AND THE SAFETY OF ALL MUST NOT BE
ENDANGERED FOR THE GOOD PLEASURE OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL

IT WILL BE SEEN TO WHAT EXAGGERATION CAPTAIN NICHOLL ALLOWED HIMSELF TO
BE CARRIED HE WAS ALONE IN HIS OPINION NOBODY TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HIS
CASSANDRA PROPHECIES THEY LET HIM EXCLAIM AS MUCH AS HE LIKED TILL HIS
THROAT WAS SORE IF HE PLEASED HE HAD CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THE DEFENDER
OF A CAUSE LOST IN ADVANCE HE WAS HEARD BUT NOT LISTENED TO AND HE DID
NOT CARRY OFF A SINGLE ADMIRER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB WHO
DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO REFUTE HIS RIVALS ARGUMENTS

NICHOLL DRIVEN INTO HIS LAST INTRENCHMENTS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIGHT
FOR HIS OPINION RESOLVED TO PAY FOR IT HE THEREFORE PROPOSED IN THE
RICHMOND INQUIRER A SERIES OF BETS CONCEIVED IN THESE TERMS AND IN AN
INCREASING PROPORTION

HE BET THAT

 THE FUNDS NECESSARY FOR THE GUN CLUBS ENTERPRISE WOULD NOT BE
FORTHCOMING  DOLS

 THAT THE CASTING OF A CANNON OF  FEET WAS IMPRACTICABLE AND WOULD
NOT SUCCEED  DOLS

 THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO LOAD THE COLUMBIAD AND THAT THE
PYROXYLE WOULD IGNITE SPONTANEOUSLY UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE PROJECTILE
 DOLS

 THAT THE COLUMBIAD WOULD BURST AT THE FIRST DISCHARGE  DOLS

 THAT THE PROJECTILE WOULD NOT EVEN GO SIX MILES AND WOULD FALL A FEW
SECONDS AFTER ITS DISCHARGE  DOLS

IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS RISKING AN IMPORTANT SUM IN HIS
INVINCIBLE OBSTINACY NO LESS THAN  DOLS WERE AT STAKE

NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WAGER HE RECEIVED ON THE TH OF
OCTOBER A SEALED PACKET OF SUPERB LACONISM COUCHED IN THESE TERMS

BALTIMORE OCTOBER TH

DONE

BARBICANE




CHAPTER XI

FLORIDA AND TEXAS


THERE STILL REMAINED ONE QUESTION TO BE DECIDEDA PLACE FAVOURABLE TO
THE EXPERIMENT HAD TO BE CHOSEN ACCORDING TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE
CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY THE GUN MUST BE AIMED PERPENDICULARLY TO THE PLANE
OF THE HORIZONTHAT IS TO SAY TOWARDS THE ZENITH NOW THE MOON ONLY
APPEARS IN THE ZENITH IN THE PLACES SITUATED BETWEEN DEG AND DEG OF
LATITUDE OR IN OTHER TERMS WHEN HER DECLINATION IS ONLY DEG THE
QUESTION WAS THEREFORE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT POINT OF THE GLOBE WHERE
THE IMMENSE COLUMBIAD SHOULD BE CAST

ON THE TH OF OCTOBER THE GUN CLUB HELD A GENERAL MEETING BARBICANE
BROUGHT A MAGNIFICENT MAP OF THE UNITED STATES BY Z BELLTROPP BUT
BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO UNFOLD IT JT MASTON ROSE WITH HIS HABITUAL
VEHEMENCE AND BEGAN TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS

HONOURABLE COLLEAGUES THE QUESTION WE ARE TO SETTLE TODAY IS REALLY
OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE AND WILL FURNISH US WITH AN OCCASION FOR DOING A
GREAT ACT OF PATRIOTISM

THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
WHAT THE ORATOR WAS COMING TO

NOT ONE OF YOU HE CONTINUED WOULD THINK OF DOING ANYTHING TO
LESSEN THE GLORY OF HIS COUNTRY AND IF THERE IS ONE RIGHT THAT THE
UNION MAY CLAIM IT IS THAT OF HARBOURING IN ITS BOSOM THE FORMIDABLE
CANNON OF THE GUN CLUB NOW UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES

WILL YOU ALLOW ME SAID BARBICANE

I DEMAND THE FREE DISCUSSION OF IDEAS REPLIED THE IMPETUOUS JT
MASTON AND I MAINTAIN THAT THE TERRITORY FROM WHICH OUR GLORIOUS
PROJECTILE WILL RISE OUGHT TO BELONG TO THE UNION

CERTAINLY ANSWERED SEVERAL MEMBERS

WELL THEN AS OUR FRONTIERS DO NOT STRETCH FAR ENOUGH AS ON THE SOUTH
THE OCEAN IS OUR LIMIT AS WE MUST SEEK BEYOND THE UNITED STATES AND IN
A NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY THIS TH PARALLEL THIS IS ALL A LEGITIMATE
CASUS BELLI AND I DEMAND THAT WAR SHOULD BE DECLARED AGAINST MEXICO

NO NO WAS CRIED FROM ALL PARTS

NO REPLIED JT MASTON I AM MUCH ASTONISHED AT HEARING SUCH A WORD
IN THESE PRECINCTS

BUT LISTEN

NEVER NEVER CRIED THE FIERY ORATOR SOONER OR LATER THIS WAR WILL
BE DECLARED AND I DEMAND THAT IT SHOULD BE THIS VERY DAY

MASTON SAID BARBICANE MAKING HIS BELL GO OFF WITH A CRASH I AGREE
WITH YOU THAT THE EXPERIMENT CANNOT AND OUGHT NOT TO BE MADE ANYWHERE
BUT ON THE SOIL OF THE UNION BUT IF I HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK BEFORE
AND YOU HAD GLANCED AT THIS MAP YOU WOULD KNOW THAT IT IS PERFECTLY
USELESS TO DECLARE WAR AGAINST OUR NEIGHBOURS FOR CERTAIN FRONTIERS OF
THE UNITED STATES EXTEND BEYOND THE TH PARALLEL LOOK WE HAVE AT OUR
DISPOSITION ALL THE SOUTHERN PART OF TEXAS AND FLORIDA

THIS INCIDENT HAD NO CONSEQUENCES STILL IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT
JT MASTON ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE CONVINCED IT WAS THEREFORE DECIDED
THAT THE COLUMBIAD SHOULD BE CAST EITHER ON THE SOIL OF TEXAS OR ON THAT
OF FLORIDA BUT THIS DECISION WAS DESTINED TO CREATE AN UNEXAMPLED
RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TOWNS OF THESE TWO STATES

THE TH PARALLEL WHEN IT TOUCHES THE AMERICAN COAST CROSSES THE
PENINSULA OF FLORIDA AND DIVIDES IT INTO TWO NEARLY EQUAL PORTIONS
THEN PLUNGING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO IT SUBTENDS THE ARC FORMED BY
THE COASTS OF ALABAMA MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA THEN SKIRTING TEXAS
OFF WHICH IT CUTS AN ANGLE IT CONTINUES ITS DIRECTION OVER MEXICO
CROSSES THE SONORA AND OLD CALIFORNIA AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE PACIFIC
OCEAN THEREFORE ONLY THE PORTIONS OF TEXAS AND FLORIDA SITUATED BELOW
THIS PARALLEL FULFILLED THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS OF LATITUDE RECOMMENDED
BY THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE

THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF FLORIDA CONTAINS NO IMPORTANT CITIES IT ONLY
BRISTLES WITH FORTS RAISED AGAINST WANDERING INDIANS ONE TOWN ONLY
TAMPA TOWN COULD PUT IN A CLAIM IN FAVOUR OF ITS POSITION

IN TEXAS ON THE CONTRARY TOWNS ARE MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE IMPORTANT
CORPUS CHRISTI IN THE COUNTY OF NUACES AND ALL THE CITIES SITUATED ON
THE RIO BRAVO LAREDO COMALITES SAN IGNACIO IN WEB RIO GRANDE CITY IN
STARR EDINBURGH IN HIDALGO SANTARITA EL PANDA AND BROWNSVILLE IN
CAMERON FORMED A POWERFUL LEAGUE AGAINST THE PRETENSIONS OF FLORIDA

THE DECISION THEREFORE WAS HARDLY MADE PUBLIC BEFORE THE FLORIDAN AND
TEXICAN DEPUTIES FLOCKED TO BALTIMORE BY THE SHORTEST WAY FROM THAT
MOMENT PRESIDENT BARBICANE AND THE INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB
WERE BESIEGED DAY AND NIGHT BY FORMIDABLE CLAIMS IF SEVEN TOWNS OF
GREECE CONTENDED FOR THE HONOUR OF BEING HOMERS BIRTHPLACE TWO ENTIRE
STATES THREATENED TO FIGHT OVER A CANNON

THESE RIVAL PARTIES WERE THEN SEEN MARCHING WITH WEAPONS ABOUT THE
STREETS OF THE TOWN EVERY TIME THEY MET A FIGHT WAS IMMINENT WHICH
WOULD HAVE HAD DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES HAPPILY THE PRUDENCE AND SKILL
OF PRESIDENT BARBICANE WARDED OFF THIS DANGER PERSONAL DEMONSTRATIONS
FOUND AN OUTLET IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE DIFFERENT STATES IT WAS THUS
THAT THE NEW YORK HERALD AND THE TRIBUNE SUPPORTED THE CLAIMS OF
TEXAS WHILST THE TIMES AND THE AMERICAN REVIEW TOOK THE PART OF THE
FLORIDAN DEPUTIES THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB DID NOT KNOW WHICH TO
LISTEN TO

TEXAS CAME UP PROUDLY WITH ITS TWENTYSIX COUNTIES WHICH IT SEEMED TO
PUT IN ARRAY BUT FLORIDA ANSWERED THAT TWELVE COUNTIES PROVED MORE THAN
TWENTYSIX IN A COUNTRY SIX TIMES SMALLER

TEXAS BRAGGED OF ITS  INHABITANTS BUT FLORIDA MUCH SMALLER
BOASTED OF BEING MUCH MORE DENSELY POPULATED WITH  BESIDES
FLORIDA ACCUSED TEXAS OF BEING THE HOME OF PALUDIAN FEVERS WHICH
CARRIED OFF ONE YEAR WITH ANOTHER SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF INHABITANTS
AND FLORIDA WAS NOT FAR WRONG

IN ITS TURN TEXAS REPLIED THAT FLORIDA NEED NOT ENVY ITS FEVERS AND
THAT IT WAS AT LEAST IMPRUDENT TO CALL OTHER COUNTRIES UNHEALTHY WHEN
FLORIDA ITSELF HAD CHRONIC VOMITO NEGRO AND TEXAS WAS NOT FAR WRONG

BESIDES ADDED THE TEXICANS THROUGH THE NEW YORK HERALD THERE ARE
RIGHTS DUE TO A STATE THAT GROWS THE BEST COTTON IN ALL AMERICA A STATE
WHICH PRODUCES HOLM OAK FOR BUILDING SHIPS A STATE THAT CONTAINS SUPERB
COAL AND MINES OF IRON THAT YIELD FIFTY PER CENT OF PURE ORE

TO THAT THE AMERICAN REVIEW ANSWERED THAT THE SOIL OF FLORIDA THOUGH
NOT SO RICH OFFERED BETTER CONDITIONS FOR THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD
AS IT WAS COMPOSED OF SAND AND CLAYGROUND

BUT ANSWERED THE TEXICANS BEFORE ANYTHING CAN BE CAST IN A PLACE
IT MUST GET TO THAT PLACE NOW COMMUNICATION WITH FLORIDA IS DIFFICULT
WHILST THE COAST OF TEXAS OFFERS GALVESTON BAY WHICH IS FOURTEEN
LEAGUES ROUND AND COULD CONTAIN ALL THE FLEETS IN THE WORLD

WHY REPLIED THE NEWSPAPERS DEVOTED TO FLORIDA YOUR GALVESTON BAY IS
SITUATED ABOVE THE TH PARALLEL WHILST OUR BAY OF ESPIRITUSANTO OPENS
PRECISELY AT THE TH DEGREE OF LATITUDE AND BY IT SHIPS GO DIRECT TO
TAMPA TOWN

A NICE BAY TRULY ANSWERED TEXAS IT IS HALFCHOKED UP WITH SAND

ANY ONE WOULD THINK TO HEAR YOU TALK CRIED FLORIDA THAT I WAS A
SAVAGE COUNTRY

WELL THE SEMINOLES DO STILL WANDER OVER YOUR PRAIRIES

AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR APACHES AND YOUR COMANCHESARE THEY CIVILISED

THE WAR HAD BEEN THUS KEPT UP FOR SOME DAYS WHEN FLORIDA TRIED TO DRAW
HER ADVERSARY UPON ANOTHER GROUND AND ONE MORNING THE TIMES
INSINUATED THAT THE ENTERPRISE BEING ESSENTIALLY AMERICAN IT OUGHT
ONLY TO BE ATTEMPTED UPON AN ESSENTIALLY AMERICAN TERRITORY

AT THESE WORDS TEXAS COULD NOT CONTAIN ITSELF

AMERICAN IT CRIED ARE WE NOT AS AMERICAN AS YOU WERE NOT TEXAS AND
FLORIDA BOTH INCORPORATED IN THE UNION IN 

CERTAINLY ANSWERED THE TIMES BUT WE HAVE BELONGED TO AMERICA
SINCE 

YES REPLIED THE TRIBUNE AFTER HAVING BEEN SPANISH OR ENGLISH FOR
 YEARS YOU WERE SOLD TO THE UNITED STATES FOR  OF DOLLARS

WHAT DOES THAT MATTER ANSWERED FLORIDA NEED WE BLUSH FOR THAT WAS
NOT LOUISIANA BOUGHT IN  FROM NAPOLEON FOR  OF DOLLARS

IT IS SHAMEFUL THEN CRIED THE TEXICAN DEPUTIES A MISERABLE SLICE OF
LAND LIKE FLORIDA TO DARE TO COMPARE ITSELF WITH TEXAS WHICH INSTEAD
OF BEING SOLD MADE ITSELF INDEPENDENT WHICH DROVE OUT THE MEXICANS ON
THE ND OF MARCH  WHICH DECLARED ITSELF FEDERATIVE REPUBLICAN
AFTER THE VICTORY GAINED BY SAMUEL HOUSTON ON THE BANKS OF THE SAN
JACINTO OVER THE TROOPS OF SANTAANNAA COUNTRY IN SHORT WHICH
VOLUNTARILY JOINED ITSELF TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

BECAUSE IT WAS AFRAID OF THE MEXICANS ANSWERED FLORIDA

AFRAID FROM THE DAY THIS WORD REALLY TOO CUTTING WAS PRONOUNCED
THE SITUATION BECAME INTOLERABLE AN ENGAGEMENT WAS EXPECTED BETWEEN THE
TWO PARTIES IN THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE THE DEPUTIES WERE OBLIGED TO BE
WATCHED

PRESIDENT BARBICANE WAS HALF DRIVEN WILD NOTES DOCUMENTS AND LETTERS
FULL OF THREATS INUNDATED HIS HOUSE WHICH COURSE OUGHT HE TO DECIDE
UPON IN THE POINT OF VIEW OF FITNESS OF SOIL FACILITY OF
COMMUNICATIONS AND RAPIDITY OF TRANSPORT THE RIGHTS OF THE TWO STATES
WERE REALLY EQUAL AS TO THE POLITICAL PERSONALITIES THEY HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE QUESTION

NOW THIS HESITATION AND EMBARRASSMENT HAD ALREADY LASTED SOME TIME WHEN
BARBICANE RESOLVED TO PUT AN END TO IT HE CALLED HIS COLLEAGUES
TOGETHER AND THE SOLUTION HE PROPOSED TO THEM WAS A PROFOUNDLY WISE
ONE AS WILL BE SEEN FROM THE FOLLOWING

AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION SAID HE OF ALL THAT HAS JUST OCCURRED
BETWEEN FLORIDA AND TEXAS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SAME DIFFICULTIES WILL
AGAIN CROP UP BETWEEN THE TOWNS OF THE FAVOURED STATE THE RIVALRY WILL
BE CHANGED FROM STATE TO CITY AND THAT IS ALL NOW TEXAS CONTAINS
ELEVEN TOWNS WITH THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS THAT WILL DISPUTE THE HONOUR
OF THE ENTERPRISE AND THAT WILL CREATE FRESH TROUBLES FOR US WHILST
FLORIDA HAS BUT ONE THEREFORE I DECIDE FOR TAMPA TOWN

THE TEXICAN DEPUTIES WERE THUNDERSTRUCK AT THIS DECISION IT PUT THEM
INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE AND THEY SENT NOMINAL PROVOCATIONS TO DIFFERENT
MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB THERE WAS ONLY ONE COURSE FOR THE MAGISTRATES
OF BALTIMORE TO TAKE AND THEY TOOK IT THEY HAD THE STEAM OF A SPECIAL
TRAIN GOT UP PACKED THE TEXICANS INTO IT WHETHER THEY WOULD OR NO AND
SENT THEM AWAY FROM THE TOWN AT A SPEED OF THIRTY MILES AN HOUR

BUT THEY WERE NOT CARRIED OFF TOO QUICKLY TO HURL A LAST AND THREATENING
SARCASM AT THEIR ADVERSARIES

MAKING ALLUSION TO THE WIDTH OF FLORIDA A SIMPLE PENINSULA BETWEEN TWO
SEAS THEY PRETENDED IT WOULD NOT RESIST THE SHOCK AND WOULD BE BLOWN
UP THE FIRST TIME THE CANNON WAS FIRED

VERY WELL LET IT BE BLOWN UP ANSWERED THE FLORIDANS WITH A LACONISM
WORTHY OF ANCIENT TIMES




CHAPTER XII

URBI ET ORBI


THE ASTRONOMICAL MECHANICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DIFFICULTIES ONCE
REMOVED THERE REMAINED THE QUESTION OF MONEY AN ENORMOUS SUM WAS
NECESSARY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT NO PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL NO
SINGLE STATE EVEN COULD HAVE DISPOSED OF THE NECESSARY MILLIONS

PRESIDENT BARBICANE HAD RESOLVEDALTHOUGH THE ENTERPRISE WAS
AMERICANTO MAKE IT A BUSINESS OF UNIVERSAL INTEREST AND TO ASK EVERY
NATION FOR ITS FINANCIAL COOPERATION IT WAS THE BOUNDED RIGHT AND DUTY
OF ALL THE EARTH TO INTERFERE IN THE BUSINESS OF THE SATELLITE THE
SUBSCRIPTION OPENED AT BALTIMORE FOR THIS END EXTENDED THENCE TO ALL
THE WORLDURBI ET ORBI

THIS SUBSCRIPTION WAS DESTINED TO SUCCEED BEYOND ALL HOPE YET THE MONEY
WAS TO BE GIVEN NOT LENT THE OPERATION WAS PURELY DISINTERESTED IN
THE LITERAL MEANING OF THE WORD AND OFFERED NO CHANCE OF GAIN

BUT THE EFFECT OF BARBICANES COMMUNICATION HAD NOT STOPPED AT THE
FRONTIERS OF THE UNITED STATES IT HAD CROSSED THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC
HAD INVADED BOTH ASIA AND EUROPE BOTH AFRICA AND OCEANIA THE
OBSERVATORIES OF THE UNION WERE IMMEDIATELY PUT INTO COMMUNICATION WITH
THE OBSERVATORIES OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES SOMETHOSE OF PARIS ST
PETERSBURG THE CAPE BERLIN ALTONA STOCKHOLM WARSAW HAMBURG BUDA
BOLOGNA MALTA LISBON BENARES MADRAS AND PEKINSENT THEIR
COMPLIMENTS TO THE GUN CLUB THE OTHERS PRUDENTLY AWAITED THE RESULT

AS TO THE GREENWICH OBSERVATORY SECONDED BY THE TWENTYTWO ASTRONOMICAL
ESTABLISHMENTS OF GREAT BRITAIN IT MADE SHORT WORK OF IT IT BOLDLY
DENIED THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESS AND TOOK UP CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
THEORIES WHILST THE DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES PROMISED TO SEND
DEPUTIES TO TAMPA TOWN THE GREENWICH STAFF MET AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY
DISMISSED THE BARBICANE PROPOSITION THIS WAS PURE ENGLISH JEALOUSY AND
NOTHING ELSE

GENERALLY SPEAKING THE EFFECT UPON THE WORLD OF SCIENCE WAS EXCELLENT
AND FROM THENCE IT PASSED TO THE MASSES WHO IN GENERAL WERE GREATLY
INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION A FACT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE SEEING THOSE
MASSES WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO SUBSCRIBE A CONSIDERABLE CAPITAL

ON THE TH OF OCTOBER PRESIDENT BARBICANE ISSUED A MANIFESTO FULL OF
ENTHUSIASM IN WHICH HE MADE APPEAL TO ALL PERSONS ON THE FACE OF THE
EARTH WILLING TO HELP THIS DOCUMENT TRANSLATED INTO EVERY LANGUAGE
HAD GREAT SUCCESS

SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE OPENED IN THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS OF THE UNION WITH A
CENTRAL OFFICE AT THE BALTIMORE BANK  BALTIMORE STREET THEN
SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE OPENED IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF THE TWO
CONTINENTSAT VIENNA BY SM DE ROTHSCHILD ST PETERSBURG STIEGLITZ
AND CO PARIS CREDIT MOBILIER STOCKHOLM TOTTIE AND ARFUREDSON
LONDON NM DE ROTHSCHILD AND SON TURIN ARDOUIN AND CO BERLIN

COPENHAGEN PRIVATE BANK BUENOS AYRES MANA BANK RIO JANEIRO MANA

LIMA THOMAS LA CHAMBRE AND CO MEXICO MARTIN DARAN AND CO

THREE DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT BARBICANES MANIFESTO  DOLLARS WERE
RECEIVED IN THE DIFFERENT TOWNS OF THE UNION WITH SUCH A SUM IN HAND
THE GUN CLUB COULD BEGIN AT ONCE

BUT A FEW DAYS LATER TELEGRAMS INFORMED AMERICA THAT FOREIGN
SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE POURING IN RAPIDLY CERTAIN COUNTRIES WERE
DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR GENEROSITY OTHERS LET GO THEIR MONEY LESS
EASILY IT WAS A MATTER OF TEMPERAMENT

HOWEVER FIGURES ARE MORE ELOQUENT THAN WORDS AND THE FOLLOWING IS AN
OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF THE SUMS PAID TO THE CREDIT OF THE GUN CLUB WHEN
THE SUBSCRIPTION WAS CLOSED

THE CONTINGENT OF RUSSIA WAS THE ENORMOUS SUM OF  ROUBLES THIS
NEED ASTONISH NO ONE WHO REMEMBERS THE SCIENTIFIC TASTE OF THE RUSSIANS
AND THE IMPETUS WHICH THEY HAVE GIVEN TO ASTRONOMICAL STUDIES THANKS TO
THEIR NUMEROUS OBSERVATORIES THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH COST 
ROUBLES

FRANCE BEGAN BY LAUGHING AT THE PRETENSIONS OF THE AMERICANS THE MOON
SERVED AS AN EXCUSE FOR A THOUSAND STALE PUNS AND A SCORE OF VAUDEVILLES
IN WHICH BAD TASTE CONTESTED THE PALM WITH IGNORANCE BUT AS THE FRENCH
FORMERLY PAID AFTER SINGING THEY NOW PAID AFTER LAUGHING AND
SUBSCRIBED A SUM OF  FRANCS AT THAT PRICE THEY BOUGHT THE
RIGHT TO JOKE A LITTLE

AUSTRIA IN THE MIDST OF HER FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES WAS SUFFICIENTLY
GENEROUS HER PART IN THE PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNTED TO 
FLORINS WHICH WERE WELCOME

SWEDEN AND NORWAY CONTRIBUTED  RIXDOLLARS THE FIGURE WAS SMALL
CONSIDERING THE COUNTRY BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN HIGHER IF A
SUBSCRIPTION HAD BEEN OPENED AT CHRISTIANIA AS WELL AS AT STOCKHOLM FOR
SOME REASON OR OTHER THE NORWEGIANS DO NOT LIKE TO SEND THEIR MONEY TO
NORWAY

PRUSSIA BY SENDING  THALERS TESTIFIED HER APPROBATION OF THE
ENTERPRISE HER DIFFERENT OBSERVATORIES CONTRIBUTED AN IMPORTANT SUM
AND WERE AMONGST THE MOST ARDENT IN ENCOURAGING PRESIDENT BARBICANE

TURKEY BEHAVED GENEROUSLY BUT SHE WAS PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE
BUSINESS THE MOON IN FACT RULES THE COURSE OF HER YEARS AND HER
RAMADAN FAST SHE COULD DO NO LESS THAN GIVE  PIASTRES AND SHE
GAVE THEM WITH AN ARDOUR THAT BETRAYED HOWEVER A CERTAIN PRESSURE FROM
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PORTE

BELGIUM DISTINGUISHED HERSELF AMONGST ALL THE SECOND ORDER OF STATES BY
A GIFT OF  FRANCS ABOUT ONE PENNY AND A FRACTION FOR EACH
INHABITANT

HOLLAND AND HER COLONIES CONTRIBUTED  FLORINS ONLY DEMANDING A
DISCOUNT OF FIVE PER CENT AS SHE PAID READY MONEY

DENMARK RATHER CONFINED FOR ROOM GAVE NOTWITHSTANDING  DUCATS
PROVING HER LOVE FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS

THE GERMANIC CONFEDERATION SUBSCRIBED  FLORINS MORE COULD NOT BE
ASKED FROM HER BESIDES SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN MORE

ALTHOUGH IN EMBARRASSED CIRCUMSTANCES ITALY FOUND  FRANCS IN
HER CHILDRENS POCKETS BUT BY TURNING THEM WELL INSIDE OUT IF SHE HAD
THEN POSSESSED VENETIA SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MORE BUT SHE DID NOT YET
POSSESS VENETIA

THE PONTIFICAL STATES THOUGHT THEY COULD NOT SEND LESS THAN  ROMAN
CROWNS AND PORTUGAL PUSHED HER DEVOTION TO THE EXTENT OF 
CRUZADES

MEXICO GENT THE WIDOWS MITE  PIASTRES BUT EMPIRES IN COURSE OF
FORMATION ARE ALWAYS IN RATHER EMBARRASSED CIRCUMSTANCES

SWITZERLAND SENT THE MODEST SUM OF  FRANCS TO THE AMERICAN SCHEME IT
MUST BE FRANKLY STATED THAT SWITZERLAND ONLY LOOKED UPON THE PRACTICAL
SIDE OF THE OPERATION THE ACTION OF SENDING A BULLET TO THE MOON DID
NOT SEEM OF A NATURE SUFFICIENT FOR THE ESTABLISHING OF ANY
COMMUNICATION WITH THE QUEEN OF NIGHT SO SWITZERLAND THOUGHT IT
IMPRUDENT TO ENGAGE CAPITAL IN AN ENTERPRISE DEPENDING UPON SUCH
UNCERTAIN EVENTS AFTER ALL SWITZERLAND WAS PERHAPS RIGHT

AS TO SPAIN SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TOGETHER MORE THAN 
REALS SHE GAVE AS AN EXCUSE THAT SHE HAD HER RAILWAYS TO FINISH THE
TRUTH IS THAT SCIENCE IS NOT LOOKED UPON VERY FAVOURABLY IN THAT
COUNTRY IT IS STILL A LITTLE BEHINDHAND AND THEN CERTAIN SPANIARDS
AND NOT THE MOST IGNORANT EITHER HAD NO CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THE SIZE OF
THE PROJECTILE COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE MOON THEY FEARED IT MIGHT
DISTURB THE SATELLITE FROM HER ORBIT AND MAKE HER FALL ON TO THE
SURFACE OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE IN THAT CASE IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT WHICH THEY CARRIED OUT WITH THAT SMALL
EXCEPTION

ENGLAND ALONE REMAINED THE CONTEMPTUOUS ANTIPATHY WITH WHICH SHE
RECEIVED BARBICANES PROPOSITION IS KNOWN THE ENGLISH HAVE BUT A SINGLE
MIND IN THEIR  OF BODIES WHICH GREAT BRITAIN CONTAINS THEY
GAVE IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ENTERPRISE OF THE GUN CLUB WAS
CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE OF NONINTERVENTION AND THEY DID NOT
SUBSCRIBE A SINGLE FARTHING

AT THIS NEWS THE GUN CLUB CONTENTED ITSELF WITH SHRUGGING ITS SHOULDERS
AND RETURNED TO ITS GREAT WORK WHEN SOUTH AMERICATHAT IS TO SAY
PERU CHILI BRAZIL THE PROVINCES OF LA PLATA AND COLUMBIAHAD POURED
INTO THEIR HANDS THEIR QUOTA OF  DOLLARS IT FOUND ITSELF
POSSESSED OF A CONSIDERABLE CAPITAL OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING IS A
STATEMENT

UNITED STATES SUBSCRIPTION  DOLLARS FOREIGN SUBSCRIPTIONS
 DOLLARS TOTAL  DOLLARS

THIS WAS THE LARGE SUM POURED BY THE PUBLIC INTO THE COFFERS OF THE GUN
CLUB

NO ONE NEED BE SURPRISED AT ITS IMPORTANCE THE WORK OF CASTING BORING
MASONRY TRANSPORT OF WORKMEN AND THEIR INSTALLATION IN AN ALMOST
UNINHABITED COUNTRY THE CONSTRUCTION OF FURNACES AND WORKSHOPS THE
MANUFACTURING TOOLS POWDER PROJECTILE AND INCIDENTAL EXPENSES WOULD
ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATES ABSORB NEARLY THE WHOLE SOME OF THE
CANNONSHOTS FIRED DURING THE WAR COST  DOLLARS EACH THAT OF
PRESIDENT BARBICANE UNIQUE IN THE ANNALS OF ARTILLERY MIGHT WELL COST
 TIMES MORE

ON THE TH OF OCTOBER A CONTRACT WAS MADE WITH THE GOLDSPRING
MANUFACTORY NEW YORK WHICH DURING THE WAR HAD FURNISHED PARROTT WITH
HIS BEST CASTIRON GUNS

IT WAS STIPULATED BETWEEN THE CONTRACTING PARTIES THAT THE GOLDSPRING
MANUFACTORY SHOULD PLEDGE ITSELF TO SEND TO TAMPA TOWN IN SOUTH
FLORIDA THE NECESSARY MATERIALS FOR THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD

THIS OPERATION WAS TO BE TERMINATED AT THE LATEST ON THE TH OF THE
NEXT OCTOBER AND THE CANNON DELIVERED IN GOOD CONDITION UNDER PENALTY
OF  DOLLARS A DAY FORFEIT UNTIL THE MOON SHOULD AGAIN PRESENT HERSELF
UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONSTHAT IS TO SAY DURING EIGHTEEN YEARS AND
ELEVEN DAYS

THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE WORKMEN THEIR PAY AND THE NECESSARY TRANSPORTS
ALL TO BE MADE BY THE GOLDSPRING COMPANY

THIS CONTRACT MADE IN DUPLICATE WAS SIGNED BY I BARBICANE PRESIDENT
OF THE GUN CLUB AND J MURPHISON MANAGER OF THE GOLDSPRING
MANUFACTORY WHO THUS SIGNED ON THE PART OF THE CONTRACTING PARTIES




CHAPTER XIII

STONY HILL


SINCE THE CHOICE MADE BY THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB TO THE DETRIMENT OF
TEXAS EVERY ONE IN AMERICAWHERE EVERY ONE KNOWS HOW TO READMADE IT
HIS BUSINESS TO STUDY THE GEOGRAPHY OF FLORIDA NEVER BEFORE HAD THE
BOOKSELLERS SOLD SO MANY BERTRAMS TRAVELS IN FLORIDA ROMANS
NATURAL HISTORY OF EAST AND WEST FLORIDA WILLIAMS TERRITORY OF
FLORIDA AND CLELAND ON THE CULTURE OF THE SUGAR CANE IN EAST
FLORIDA NEW EDITIONS OF THESE WORKS WERE REQUIRED THERE WAS QUITE A
RAGE FOR THEM

BARBICANE HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO READ HE WISHED TO SEE WITH
HIS OWN EYES AND CHOOSE THE SITE OF THE COLUMBIAD THEREFORE WITHOUT
LOSING A MOMENT HE PUT THE FUNDS NECESSARY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
TELESCOPE AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY AND MADE A
CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM OF BREADWILL AND CO OF ALBANY FOR THE MAKING
OF THE ALUMINIUM PROJECTILE THEN HE LEFT BALTIMORE ACCOMPANIED BY JT
MASTON MAJOR ELPHINSTONE AND THE MANAGER OF THE GOLDSPRING
MANUFACTORY

THE NEXT DAY THE FOUR TRAVELLING COMPANIONS REACHED NEW ORLEANS THERE
THEY EMBARKED ON BOARD THE TAMPICO A DESPATCHBOAT BELONGING TO THE
FEDERAL NAVY WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAD PLACED AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND
WITH ALL STEAM ON THEY QUICKLY LOST SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF LOUISIANA

THE PASSAGE WAS NOT A LONG ONE TWO DAYS AFTER ITS DEPARTURE THE
TAMPICO HAVING MADE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILES SIGHTED THE
FLORIDIAN COAST AS IT APPROACHED BARBICANE SAW A LOW FLAT COAST
LOOKING RATHER UNFERTILE AFTER COASTING A SERIES OF CREEKS RICH IN
OYSTERS AND LOBSTERS THE TAMPICO ENTERED THE BAY OF ESPIRITUSANTO

THIS BAY IS DIVIDED INTO TWO LONG ROADSTEADS THOSE OF TAMPA AND
HILLISBORO THE NARROW ENTRANCE TO WHICH THE STEAMER SOON CLEARED A
SHORT TIME AFTERWARDS THE BATTERIES OF FORT BROOKE ROSE ABOVE THE WAVES
AND THE TOWN OF TAMPA APPEARED CARELESSLY LYING ON A LITTLE NATURAL
HARBOUR FORMED BY THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HILLISBORO

THERE THE TAMPICO ANCHORED ON OCTOBER ND AT SEVEN PM THE FOUR
PASSENGERS LANDED IMMEDIATELY

BARBICANE FELT HIS HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY AS HE SET FOOT ON FLORIDIAN
SOIL HE SEEMED TO FEEL IT WITH HIS FEET LIKE AN ARCHITECT TRYING THE
SOLIDITY OF A HOUSE JT MASTON SCRATCHED THE GROUND WITH HIS STEEL
HOOK

GENTLEMEN THEN SAID BARBICANE WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE AND WE WILL
SET OFF ON HORSEBACK TOMORROW TO SURVEY THE COUNTRY

THE MINUTE BARBICANE LANDED THE THREE THOUSAND INHABITANTS OF TAMPA TOWN
WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AN HONOUR QUITE DUE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN
CLUB WHO HAD DECIDED IN THEIR FAVOUR THEY RECEIVED HIM WITH FORMIDABLE
EXCLAMATIONS BUT BARBICANE ESCAPED AN OVATION BY SHUTTING HIMSELF UP IN
HIS ROOM AT THE FRANKLIN HOTEL AND REFUSING TO SEE ANY ONE

THE NEXT DAY OCTOBER RD SMALL HORSES OF SPANISH RACE FULL OF FIRE
AND VIGOUR PAWED THE GROUND UNDER HIS WINDOWS BUT INSTEAD OF FOUR
THERE WERE FIFTY WITH THEIR RIDERS BARBICANE WENT DOWN ACCOMPANIED BY
HIS THREE COMPANIONS WHO WERE AT FIRST ASTONISHED TO FIND THEMSELVES IN
THE MIDST OF SUCH A CAVALCADE HE REMARKED BESIDES THAT EACH HORSEMAN
CARRIED A CARBINE SLUNG ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS AND PISTOLS IN HIS
HOLSTERS THE REASON FOR SUCH A DISPLAY OF FORCE WAS IMMEDIATELY GIVEN
HIM BY A YOUNG FLORIDIAN WHO SAID TO HIM

SIR THE SEMINOLES ARE THERE

WHAT SEMINOLES

SAVAGES WHO FREQUENT THE PRAIRIES AND WE DEEMED IT PRUDENT TO GIVE YOU
AN ESCORT

POOH EXCLAIMED JT MASTON AS HE MOUNTED HIS STEED

IT IS WELL TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE ANSWERED THE FLORIDIAN

GENTLEMEN REPLIED BARBICANE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND NOW
LET US BE OFF

THE LITTLE TROOP SET OUT IMMEDIATELY AND DISAPPEARED IN A CLOUD OF
DUST IT WAS FIVE AM THE SUN SHONE BRILLIANTLY ALREADY AND THE
THERMOMETER INDICATED DEG BUT FRESH SEA BREEZES MODERATED THIS
EXCESSIVE HEAT

BARBICANE ON LEAVING TAMPA TOWN WENT DOWN SOUTH AND FOLLOWED THE COAST
TO ALIFIA CREEK THIS SMALL RIVER FALLS INTO HILLISBORO BAY TWELVE
MILES BELOW TAMPA TOWN BARBICANE AND HIS ESCORT FOLLOWED ITS RIGHT BANK
GOING UP TOWARDS THE EAST THE WAVES OF THE BAY DISAPPEARED BEHIND AN
INEQUALITY IN THE GROUND AND THE FLORIDIAN COUNTRY WAS ALONE IN SIGHT

FLORIDA IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS THE ONE TO THE NORTH MORE POPULOUS
AND LESS ABANDONED HAS TALLAHASSEE FOR CAPITAL AND PENSACOLA ONE OF
THE PRINCIPAL MARINE ARSENALS OF THE UNITED STATES THE OTHER LYING
BETWEEN THE ATLANTIC AND THE GULF OF MEXICO IS ONLY A NARROW PENINSULA
EATEN AWAY BY THE CURRENT OF THE GULF STREAMA LITTLE TONGUE OF LAND
LOST AMIDST A SMALL ARCHIPELAGO WHICH THE NUMEROUS VESSELS OF THE
BAHAMA CHANNEL DOUBLE CONTINUALLY IT IS THE ADVANCED SENTINEL OF THE
GULF OF GREAT TEMPESTS THE SUPERFICIAL AREA OF THIS STATE MEASURES
 ACRES AMONGST WHICH ONE HAD TO BE CHOSEN SITUATED BEYOND THE
TH PARALLEL AND SUITABLE FOR THE ENTERPRISE AS BARBICANE RODE ALONG
HE ATTENTIVELY EXAMINED THE CONFIGURATION OF THE GROUND AND ITS
PARTICULAR DISTRIBUTION

FLORIDA DISCOVERED BY JUAN PONCE DE LEON IN  ON PALM SUNDAY WAS
FIRST OF ALL NAMED PASCHA FLORIDA IT WAS WELL WORTHY OF THAT
DESIGNATION WITH ITS DRY AND ARID COASTS BUT A FEW MILES FROM THE SHORE
THE NATURE OF THE GROUND GRADUALLY CHANGED AND THE COUNTRY SHOWED
ITSELF WORTHY OF ITS NAME THE SOIL WAS CUT UP BY A NETWORK OF CREEKS
RIVERS WATERCOURSES PONDS AND SMALL LAKES IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
MISTAKEN FOR HOLLAND OR GUIANA BUT THE GROUND GRADUALLY ROSE AND SOON
SHOWED ITS CULTIVATED PLAINS WHERE ALL THE VEGETABLES OF THE NORTH AND
SOUTH GROW IN PERFECTION ITS IMMENSE FIELDS WHERE A TROPICAL SUN AND
THE WATER CONSERVED IN ITS CLAYEY TEXTURE DO ALL THE WORK OF
CULTIVATING AND LASTLY ITS PRAIRIES OF PINEAPPLES YAMS TOBACCO RICE
COTTON AND SUGARCANES WHICH EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH
SPREADING OUT THEIR RICHES WITH CARELESS PRODIGALITY

BARBICANE APPEARED GREATLY SATISFIED ON FINDING THE PROGRESSIVE
ELEVATION OF THE GROUND AND WHEN JT MASTON QUESTIONED HIM ON THE
SUBJECT

MY WORTHY FRIEND SAID HE IT IS GREATLY TO OUR INTEREST TO CAST OUR
COLUMBIAD ON ELEVATED GROUND

IN ORDER TO BE NEARER THE MOON EXCLAIMED THE SECRETARY OF THE GUN
CLUB

NO ANSWERED BARBICANE SMILING WHAT CAN A FEW YARDS MORE OR LESS
MATTER NO BUT ON ELEVATED GROUND OUR WORK CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED MORE
EASILY WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO STRUGGLE AGAINST WATER WHICH WILL SAVE US
LONG AND EXPENSIVE TUBINGS AND THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
WHEN A WELL  FEET DEEP HAS TO BE SUNK

YOU ARE RIGHT SAID MURCHISON THE ENGINEER WE MUST AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE AVOID WATERCOURSES DURING THE CASTING BUT IF WE MEET WITH
SPRINGS THEY WILL NOT MATTER MUCH WE CAN EXHAUST THEM WITH OUR MACHINES
OR DIVERT THEM FROM THEIR COURSE HERE WE HAVE NOT TO WORK AT AN
ARTESIAN WELL NARROW AND DARK WHERE ALL THE BORING IMPLEMENTS HAVE TO
WORK IN THE DARK NO WE CAN WORK UNDER THE OPEN SKY WITH SPADE AND
PICKAXE AND BY THE HELP OF BLASTING OUR WORK WILL NOT TAKE LONG

STILL RESUMED BARBICANE IF BY THE ELEVATION OF THE GROUND OR ITS
NATURE WE CAN AVOID A STRUGGLE WITH SUBTERRANEAN WATERS WE CAN DO OUR
WORK MORE RAPIDLY AND PERFECTLY WE MUST THEREFORE MAKE OUR CUTTING IN
GROUND SITUATED SOME THOUSANDS OF FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA

YOU ARE RIGHT MR BARBICANE AND IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN WE SHALL SOON
FIND A SUITABLE SPOT

I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE FIRST SPADEFUL TURNED UP SAID THE PRESIDENT

AND I THE LAST EXCLAIMED JT MASTON

WE SHALL MANAGE IT GENTLEMEN ANSWERED THE ENGINEER AND BELIEVE
ME THE GOLDSPRING COMPANY WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY YOU ANY FORFEIT FOR
DELAY

FAITH IT HAD BETTER NOT REPLIED JT MASTON A HUNDRED DOLLARS A
DAY TILL THE MOON PRESENTS HERSELF IN THE SAME CONDITIONSTHAT IS TO
SAY FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND ELEVEN DAYSDO YOU KNOW THAT WOULD MAKE
 DOLLARS

NO SIR WE DO NOT KNOW AND WE SHALL NOT NEED TO LEARN

ABOUT TEN AM THE LITTLE TROOP HAD JOURNEYED ABOUT TWELVE MILES TO THE
FERTILE COUNTRY SUCCEEDED A FOREST REGION THERE WERE THE MOST VARIED
PERFUMES IN TROPICAL PROFUSION THE ALMOST IMPENETRABLE FORESTS WERE
MADE UP OF POMEGRANATES ORANGE CITRON FIG OLIVE AND APRICOT TREES
BANANAS HUGE VINES THE BLOSSOMS AND FRUIT OF WHICH RIVALLED EACH OTHER
IN COLOUR AND PERFUME UNDER THE PERFUMED SHADE OF THESE MAGNIFICENT
TREES SANG AND FLUTTERED A WORLD OF BRILLIANTLYCOLOURED BIRDS AMONGST
WHICH THE CRABEATER DESERVED A JEWEL CASKET WORTHY OF ITS FEATHERED
GEMS FOR A NEST

JT MASTON AND THE MAJOR COULD NOT PASS THROUGH SUCH OPULENT NATURE
WITHOUT ADMIRING ITS SPLENDID BEAUTY

BUT PRESIDENT BARBICANE WHO THOUGHT LITTLE OF THESE MARVELS WAS IN A
HURRY TO HASTEN ONWARDS THIS COUNTRY SO FERTILE DISPLEASED HIM BY ITS
VERY FERTILITY WITHOUT BEING OTHERWISE HYDROPICAL HE FELT WATER UNDER
HIS FEET AND SOUGHT IN VAIN THE SIGNS OF INCONTESTABLE ARIDITY

IN THE MEANTIME THEY JOURNEYED ON THEY WERE OBLIGED TO FORD SEVERAL
RIVERS AND NOT WITHOUT DANGER FOR THEY WERE INFESTED WITH ALLIGATORS
FROM FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN FEET LONG JT MASTON THREATENED THEM BOLDLY
WITH HIS FORMIDABLE HOOK BUT HE ONLY SUCCEEDED IN FRIGHTENING THE
PELICANS PHAETONS AND TEALS THAT FREQUENTED THE BANKS WHILE THE RED
FLAMINGOES LOOKED ON WITH A STUPID STARE

AT LAST THESE INHABITANTS OF HUMID COUNTRIES DISAPPEARED IN THEIR TURN
THE TREES BECAME SMALLER AND MORE THINLY SCATTERED IN SMALLER WOODS
SOME ISOLATED GROUPS STOOD AMIDST IMMENSE PLAINS WHERE RANGED HERDS OF
STARTLED DEER

AT LAST EXCLAIMED BARBICANE RISING IN HIS STIRRUPS HERE IS THE
REGION OF PINES

AND SAVAGES ANSWERED THE MAJOR

IN FACT A FEW SEMINOLES APPEARED ON THE HORIZON THEY MOVED ABOUT
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON THEIR FLEET HORSES BRANDISHING LONG LANCES OR
FIRING THEIR GUNS WITH A DULL REPORT HOWEVER THEY CONFINED THEMSELVES
TO THESE HOSTILE DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH HAD NO EFFECT ON BARBICANE AND
HIS COMPANIONS

THEY WERE THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROCKY PLAIN A VAST OPEN SPACE OF
SEVERAL ACRES IN EXTENT WHICH THE SUN COVERED WITH BURNING RAYS IT WAS
FORMED BY A WIDE ELEVATION OF THE SOIL AND SEEMED TO OFFER TO THE
MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB ALL THE REQUIRED CONDITIONS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THEIR COLUMBIAD

HALT CRIED BARBICANE STOPPING HAS THIS PLACE ANY NAME

IT IS CALLED STONY HILL ANSWERED THE FLORIDIANS

BARBICANE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD DISMOUNTED TOOK HIS INSTRUMENTS AND
BEGAN TO FIX HIS POSITION WITH EXTREME PRECISION THE LITTLE TROOP DRAWN
UP AROUND HIM WATCHED HIM IN PROFOUND SILENCE

AT THAT MOMENT THE SUN PASSED THE MERIDIAN BARBICANE AFTER AN
INTERVAL RAPIDLY NOTED THE RESULT OF HIS OBSERVATION AND SAID

THIS PLACE IS SITUATED  FEET ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL IN LAT DEG 
AND WEST LONG DEG  BY THE WASHINGTON MERIDIAN IT APPEARS TO ME BY ITS
BARREN AND ROCKY NATURE TO OFFER EVERY CONDITION FAVOURABLE TO OUR
ENTERPRISE WE WILL THEREFORE RAISE OUR MAGAZINES WORKSHOPS FURNACES
AND WORKMENS HUTS HERE AND IT IS FROM THIS VERY SPOT SAID HE
STAMPING UPON IT WITH HIS FOOT THE SUMMIT OF STONY HILL THAT OUR
PROJECTILE WILL START FOR THE REGIONS OF THE SOLAR WORLD




CHAPTER XIV

PICKAXE AND TROWEL


THAT SAME EVENING BARBICANE AND HIS COMPANIONS RETURNED TO TAMPA TOWN
AND MURCHISON THE ENGINEER REEMBARKED ON BOARD THE TAMPICO FOR NEW
ORLEANS HE WAS TO ENGAGE AN ARMY OF WORKMEN TO BRING BACK THE GREATER
PART OF THE WORKINGSTOCK THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB REMAINED AT TAMPA
TOWN IN ORDER TO SET ON FOOT THE PRELIMINARY WORK WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF
THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY

EIGHT DAYS AFTER ITS DEPARTURE THE TAMPICO RETURNED TO THE
ESPIRITUSANTO BAY WITH A FLEET OF STEAMBOATS MURCHISON HAD SUCCEEDED
IN GETTING TOGETHER  WORKMEN IN THE EVIL DAYS OF SLAVERY HE WOULD
HAVE LOST HIS TIME AND TROUBLE BUT SINCE AMERICA THE LAND OF LIBERTY
HAS ONLY CONTAINED FREEMEN THEY FLOCK WHEREVER THEY CAN GET GOOD PAY
NOW MONEY WAS NOT WANTING TO THE GUN CLUB IT OFFERED A HIGH RATE OF
WAGES WITH CONSIDERABLE AND PROPORTIONATE PERQUISITES THE WORKMAN
ENLISTED FOR FLORIDA COULD ONCE THE WORK FINISHED DEPEND UPON A
CAPITAL PLACED IN HIS NAME IN THE BANK OF BALTIMORE

MURCHISON HAD THEREFORE ONLY TO PICK AND CHOOSE AND COULD BE SEVERE
ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE AND SKILL OF HIS WORKMEN HE ENROLLED IN HIS
WORKING LEGION THE PICK OF MECHANICS STOKERS IRONFOUNDERS
LIMEBURNERS MINERS BRICKMAKERS AND ARTISANS OF EVERY SORT WHITE OR
BLACK WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF COLOUR MANY OF THEM BROUGHT THEIR FAMILIES
WITH THEM IT WAS QUITE AN EMIGRATION

ON THE ST OF OCTOBER AT  AM THIS TROOP LANDED ON THE QUAYS OF
TAMPA TOWN THE MOVEMENT AND ACTIVITY WHICH REIGNED IN THE LITTLE TOWN
THAT HAD THUS DOUBLED ITS POPULATION IN A SINGLE DAY MAY BE IMAGINED IN
FACT TAMPA TOWN WAS ENORMOUSLY BENEFITED BY THIS ENTERPRISE OF THE GUN
CLUB NOT BY THE NUMBER OF WORKMEN WHO WERE IMMEDIATELY DRAFTED TO STONY
HILL BUT BY THE INFLUX OF CURIOUS IDLERS WHO CONVERGED BY DEGREES FROM
ALL POINTS OF THE GLOBE TOWARDS THE FLORIDIAN PENINSULA

DURING THE FIRST FEW DAYS THEY WERE OCCUPIED IN UNLOADING THE FLOTILLA
OF THE TOOLS MACHINES PROVISIONS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF PLATE IRON
HOUSES MADE IN PIECES SEPARATELY PIECED AND NUMBERED AT THE SAME TIME
BARBICANE LAID THE FIRST SLEEPERS OF A RAILWAY FIFTEEN MILES LONG THAT
WAS DESTINED TO UNITE STONY HILL AND TAMPA TOWN

IT IS KNOWN HOW AMERICAN RAILWAYS ARE CONSTRUCTED WITH CAPRICIOUS
BENDS BOLD SLOPES STEEP HILLS AND DEEP VALLEYS THEY DO NOT COST MUCH
AND ARE NOT MUCH IN THEIR WAY ONLY THEIR TRAINS RUN OFF OR JUMP OFF AS
THEY PLEASE THE RAILWAY FROM TAMPA TOWN TO STONY HILL WAS BUT A TRIFLE
AND WANTED NEITHER MUCH TIME NOR MUCH MONEY FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION

BARBICANE WAS THE SOUL OF THIS ARMY OF WORKMEN WHO HAD COME AT HIS CALL
HE ANIMATED THEM COMMUNICATED TO THEM HIS ARDOUR ENTHUSIASM AND
CONVICTION HE WAS EVERYWHERE AT ONCE AS IF ENDOWED WITH THE GIFT OF
UBIQUITY AND ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY JT MASTON HIS BLUEBOTTLE FLY HIS
PRACTICAL MIND INVENTED A THOUSAND THINGS WITH HIM THERE WERE NO
OBSTACLES DIFFICULTIES OR EMBARRASSMENT HE WAS AS GOOD A MINER
MASON AND MECHANIC AS HE WAS AN ARTILLERYMAN HAVING AN ANSWER TO EVERY
QUESTION AND A SOLUTION TO EVERY PROBLEM HE CORRESPONDED ACTIVELY WITH
THE GUN CLUB AND THE GOLDSPRING MANUFACTORY AND DAY AND NIGHT THE
TAMPICO KEPT HER STEAM UP AWAITING HIS ORDERS IN HILLISBORO HARBOUR

BARBICANE ON THE ST OF NOVEMBER LEFT TAMPA TOWN WITH A DETACHMENT OF
WORKMEN AND THE VERY NEXT DAY A SMALL TOWN OF WORKMENS HOUSES ROSE
ROUND STONY HILL THEY SURROUNDED IT WITH PALISADES AND FROM ITS
MOVEMENT AND ARDOUR IT MIGHT SOON HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THE GREAT
CITIES OF THE UNION LIFE WAS REGULATED AT ONCE AND WORK BEGAN IN
PERFECT ORDER

CAREFUL BORING HAD ESTABLISHED THE NATURE OF THE GROUND AND DIGGING WAS
BEGUN ON NOVEMBER TH THAT DAY BARBICANE CALLED HIS FOREMEN TOGETHER
AND SAID TO THEM

YOU ALL KNOW MY FRIENDS WHY I HAVE CALLED YOU TOGETHER IN THIS PART
OF FLORIDA WE WANT TO CAST A CANNON NINE FEET IN DIAMETER SIX FEET
THICK AND WITH A STONE REVETMENT NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET THICK WE
THEREFORE WANT A WELL  FEET WIDE AND  FEET DEEP THIS LARGE WORK
MUST BE TERMINATED IN NINE MONTHS YOU HAVE THEREFORE  CUBIC
FEET OF SOIL TO DIG OUT IN  DAYSTHAT IS TO SAY  CUBIC FEET A
DAY THAT WOULD OFFER NO DIFFICULTY IF YOU HAD PLENTY OF ELBOWROOM BUT
AS YOU WILL ONLY HAVE A LIMITED SPACE IT WILL BE MORE TROUBLE
NEVERTHELESS AS THE WORK MUST BE DONE IT WILL BE DONE AND I DEPEND UPON
YOUR COURAGE AS MUCH AS UPON YOUR SKILL

AT  AM THE FIRST SPADEFUL WAS DUG OUT OF THE FLORIDIAN SOIL AND FROM
THAT MOMENT THIS USEFUL TOOL DID NOT STOP IDLE A MOMENT IN THE HANDS OF
THE MINER THE GANGS RELIEVED EACH OTHER EVERY THREE HOURS

BESIDES ALTHOUGH THE WORK WAS COLOSSAL IT DID NOT EXCEED THE LIMIT OF
HUMAN CAPABILITY FAR FROM THAT HOW MANY WORKS OF MUCH GREATER
DIFFICULTY AND IN WHICH THE ELEMENTS HAD TO BE MORE DIRECTLY CONTENDED
AGAINST HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO A SUCCESSFUL TERMINATION SUFFICE IT TO
MENTION THE WELL OF FATHER JOSEPH MADE NEAR CAIRO BY THE SULTAN SALADIN
AT AN EPOCH WHEN MACHINES HAD NOT YET APPEARED TO INCREASE THE STRENGTH
OF MAN A HUNDREDFOLD AND WHICH GOES DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF THE NILE
ITSELF AT A DEPTH OF  FEET AND THAT OTHER WELL DUG AT COBLENTZ BY
THE MARGRAVE JEAN OF BADEN  FEET DEEP ALL THAT WAS NEEDED WAS A
TRIPLE DEPTH AND A DOUBLE WIDTH WHICH MADE THE BORING EASIER THERE WAS
NOT ONE FOREMAN OR WORKMAN WHO DOUBTED ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE
OPERATION

AN IMPORTANT DECISION TAKEN BY MURCHISON AND APPROVED OF BY BARBICANE
ACCELERATED THE WORK AN ARTICLE IN THE CONTRACT DECIDED THAT THE
COLUMBIAD SHOULD BE HOOPED WITH WROUGHTIRONA USELESS PRECAUTION FOR
THE CANNON COULD EVIDENTLY DO WITHOUT HOOPS THIS CLAUSE WAS THEREFORE
GIVEN UP HENCE A GREAT ECONOMY OF TIME FOR THEY COULD THEN EMPLOY THE
NEW SYSTEM OF BORING NOW USED FOR DIGGING WELLS BY WHICH THE MASONRY IS
DONE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BORING THANKS TO THIS VERY SIMPLE
OPERATION THEY WERE NOT OBLIGED TO PROP UP THE GROUND THE WALL KEPT IT
UP AND WENT DOWN BY ITS OWN WEIGHT

THIS MANOEUVRE WAS ONLY TO BEGIN WHEN THE SPADE SHOULD HAVE REACHED THE
SOLID PART OF THE GROUND

ON THE TH OF NOVEMBER FIFTY WORKMEN BEGAN TO DIG IN THE VERY CENTRE OF
THE INCLOSURE SURROUNDED BY PALISADESTHAT IS TO SAY THE TOP OF STONY
HILLA CIRCULAR HOLE SIXTY FEET WIDE

THE SPADE FIRST TURNED UP A SORT OF BLACK SOIL SIX INCHES DEEP WHICH IT
SOON CARRIED AWAY TO THIS SOIL SUCCEEDED TWO FEET OF FINE SAND WHICH
WAS CAREFULLY TAKEN OUT AS IT WAS TO BE USED FOR THE CASTING

AFTER THIS SAND WHITE CLAY APPEARED SIMILAR TO ENGLISH CHALK AND WHICH
WAS FOUR FEET THICK

THEN THE PICKAXES RANG UPON THE HARD LAYER A SPECIES OF ROCK FORMED BY
VERY DRY PETRIFIED SHELLS AT THAT POINT THE HOLE WAS SIX AND A HALF
FEET DEEP AND THE MASONRY WAS BEGUN

AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT EXCAVATION THEY MADE AN OAK WHEEL A SORT OF
CIRCLE STRONGLY BOLTED AND OF ENORMOUS STRENGTH IN ITS CENTRE A HOLE
WAS PIERCED THE SIZE OF THE EXTERIOR DIAMETER OF THE COLUMBIAD IT WAS
UPON THIS WHEEL THAT THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE MASONRY WERE PLACED THE
HYDRAULIC CEMENT OF WHICH JOINED THE STONES SOLIDLY TOGETHER AFTER THE
WORKMEN HAD BRICKED UP THE SPACE FROM THE CIRCUMFERENCE TO THE CENTRE
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES INCLOSED IN A WELL TWENTYONE FEET WIDE

WHEN THIS WORK WAS ENDED THE MINERS BEGAN AGAIN WITH SPADE AND PICKAXE
AND SET UPON THE ROCK UNDER THE WHEEL ITSELF TAKING CARE TO SUPPORT IT
ON EXTREMELY STRONG TRESSELS EVERY TIME THE HOLE WAS TWO FEET DEEPER
THEY TOOK AWAY THE TRESSELS THE WHEEL GRADUALLY SANK TAKING WITH IT
ITS CIRCLE OF MASONRY AT THE UPPER LAYER OF WHICH THE MASONS WORKED
INCESSANTLY TAKING CARE TO MAKE VENTHOLES FOR THE ESCAPE OF GAS DURING
THE OPERATION OF CASTING

THIS KIND OF WORK REQUIRED GREAT SKILL AND CONSTANT ATTENTION ON THE
PART OF THE WORKMEN MORE THAN ONE DIGGING UNDER THE WHEEL WAS
DANGEROUS AND SOME WERE EVEN MORTALLY WOUNDED BY THE SPLINTERS OF
STONE BUT THEIR ENERGY DID NOT SLACKEN FOR A MOMENT BY DAY NOR NIGHT
BY DAY WHEN THE SUNS RAYS SENT THE THERMOMETER UP TO DEG ON THE
CALCINED PLANES BY NIGHT UNDER THE WHITE WAVES OF ELECTRIC LIGHT THE
NOISE OF THE PICKAXE ON THE ROCK THE BLASTING AND THE MACHINES
TOGETHER WITH THE WREATHS OF SMOKE SCATTERED THROUGH THE AIR TRACED A
CIRCLE OF TERROR ROUND STONY HILL WHICH THE HERDS OF BUFFALOES AND THE
DETACHMENTS OF SEMINOLES NEVER DARED TO PASS

IN THE MEANTIME THE WORK REGULARLY ADVANCED STEAMCRANES SPEEDED THE
CARRYING AWAY OF THE RUBBISH OF UNEXPECTED OBSTACLES THERE WERE NONE
ALL THE DIFFICULTIES HAD BEEN FORESEEN AND GUARDED AGAINST

WHEN THE FIRST MONTH HAD GONE BY THE WELL HAD ATTAINED THE DEPTH
ASSIGNED FOR THE TIMEIE  FEET IN DECEMBER THIS DEPTH WAS
DOUBLED AND TRIPLED IN JANUARY DURING FEBRUARY THE WORKMEN HAD TO
CONTEND AGAINST A SHEET OF WATER WHICH SPRANG FROM THE GROUND THEY WERE
OBLIGED TO EMPLOY POWERFUL PUMPS AND APPARATUS OF COMPRESSED AIR TO
DRAIN IT OFF SO AS TO CLOSE UP THE ORIFICE FROM WHICH IT ISSUED JUST
AS LEAKS ARE CAULKED ON BOARD SHIP AT LAST THEY GOT THE BETTER OF THESE
UNWELCOME SPRINGS ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LOOSENING OF THE SOIL THE
WHEEL PARTIALLY GAVE WAY AND THERE WAS A LANDSLIP THE FRIGHTFUL FORCE
OF THIS BRICKED CIRCLE MORE THAN  FEET HIGH MAY BE IMAGINED THIS
ACCIDENT COST THE LIFE OF SEVERAL WORKMEN THREE WEEKS HAD TO BE TAKEN
UP IN PROPPING THE STONE REVETMENT AND MAKING THE WHEEL SOLID AGAIN
BUT THANKS TO THE SKILL OF THE ENGINEER AND THE POWER OF THE MACHINES
IT WAS ALL SET RIGHT AND THE BORING CONTINUED

NO FRESH INCIDENT HENCEFORTH STOPPED THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK AND ON
THE TH OF JUNE TWENTY DAYS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE DELAY FIXED
BY BARBICANE THE WELL QUITE BRICKED ROUND HAD REACHED THE DEPTH OF
 FEET AT THE BOTTOM THE MASONRY RESTED UPON A MASSIVE BLOCK THIRTY
FEET THICK WHILST AT THE TOP IT WAS ON A LEVEL WITH THE SOIL

PRESIDENT BARBICANE AND THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB WARMLY CONGRATULATED
THE ENGINEER MURCHISON HIS CYCLOPEAN WORK HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH
EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY

DURING THESE EIGHT MONTHS BARBICANE DID NOT LEAVE STONY HILL FOR A
MINUTE WHILST HE NARROWLY WATCHED OVER THE BORING OPERATIONS HE TOOK
EVERY PRECAUTION TO INSURE THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF HIS WORKMEN AND
HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO AVOID THE EPIDEMICS COMMON TO LARGE
AGGLOMERATIONS OF MEN AND SO DISASTROUS IN THOSE REGIONS OF THE GLOBE
EXPOSED TO TROPICAL INFLUENCE

IT IS TRUE THAT SEVERAL WORKMEN PAID WITH THEIR LIVES FOR THE
CARELESSNESS ENGENDERED BY THESE DANGEROUS OCCUPATIONS BUT SUCH
DEPLORABLE MISFORTUNES CANNOT BE AVOIDED AND THESE ARE DETAILS THAT
AMERICANS PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THEY ARE MORE OCCUPIED WITH
HUMANITY IN GENERAL THAN WITH INDIVIDUALS IN PARTICULAR HOWEVER
BARBICANE PROFESSED THE CONTRARY PRINCIPLES AND APPLIED THEM UPON EVERY
OCCASION THANKS TO HIS CARE TO HIS INTELLIGENCE AND RESPECTFUL
INTERVENTION IN DIFFICULT CASES TO HIS PRODIGIOUS AND HUMANE WISDOM
THE AVERAGE OF CATASTROPHES DID NOT EXCEED THAT OF CITIES ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC AMONGST OTHERS THOSE OF FRANCE WHERE THEY COUNT
ABOUT ONE ACCIDENT UPON EVERY  FRANCS OF WORK




CHAPTER XV

THE CEREMONY OF THE CASTING


DURING THE EIGHT MONTHS THAT WERE EMPLOYED IN THE OPERATION OF BORING
THE PREPARATORY WORKS OF THE CASTING HAD BEEN CONDUCTED SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY A STRANGER ARRIVING AT STONY HILL WOULD HAVE BEEN
MUCH SURPRISED AT WHAT HE SAW THERE

SIX HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE WELL AND STANDING IN A CIRCLE ROUND IT AS A
CENTRAL POINT WERE  FURNACES EACH SIX FEET WIDE AND THREE YARDS
APART THE LINE MADE BY THESE  FURNACES WAS TWO MILES LONG THEY
WERE ALL BUILT ON THE SAME MODEL WITH HIGH QUADRANGULAR CHIMNEYS AND
HAD A SINGULAR EFFECT JT MASTON THOUGHT THE ARCHITECTURAL ARRANGEMENT
SUPERB IT REMINDED HIM OF THE MONUMENTS AT WASHINGTON HE THOUGHT THERE
WAS NOTHING FINER IN THE WORLD NOT EVEN IN GREECE WHERE HE
ACKNOWLEDGED NEVER TO HAVE BEEN

IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THEIR THIRD MEETING THE COMMITTEE DECIDED
TO USE CASTIRON FOR THE COLUMBIAD AND IN PARTICULAR THE GREY
DESCRIPTION THIS METAL IS IN FACT THE MOST TENACIOUS DUCTILE AND
MALLEABLE SUITABLE FOR ALL MOULDING OPERATIONS AND WHEN SMELTED WITH
PIT COAL IT IS OF SUPERIOR QUALITY FOR ENGINECYLINDERS HYDRAULIC
PRESSES C

BUT CASTIRON IF IT HAS UNDERGONE A SINGLE FUSION IS RARELY
HOMOGENEOUS ENOUGH AND IT IS BY MEANS OF A SECOND FUSION THAT IT IS
PURIFIED REFINED AND DISPOSSESSED OF ITS LAST EARTHLY DEPOSITS

BEFORE BEING FORWARDED TO TAMPA TOWN THE IRON ORE SMELTED IN THE GREAT
FURNACES OF GOLDSPRING AND PUT IN CONTACT WITH COAL AND SILICIUM HEATED
TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO CASTIRON AFTER THIS FIRST
OPERATION THE METAL WAS TAKEN TO STONY HILL BUT THERE WERE  MILLIONS
OF POUNDS OF CASTIRON A BULK TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE SENT BY RAILWAY THE
PRICE OF TRANSPORT WOULD HAVE DOUBLED THAT OF THE RAW MATERIAL IT
APPEARED PREFERABLE TO FREIGHT VESSELS AT NEW YORK AND TO LOAD THEM WITH
THE IRON IN BARS NO LESS THAN SIXTYEIGHT VESSELS OF  TONS WERE
REQUIRED QUITE A FLEET WHICH ON MAY RD LEFT NEW YORK TOOK THE OCEAN
ROUTE COASTED THE AMERICAN SHORES ENTERED THE BAHAMA CHANNEL DOUBLED
THE POINT OF FLORIDA AND ON THE TH OF THE SAME MONTH ENTERED THE BAY
OF ESPIRITUSANTO AND ANCHORED SAFELY IN THE PORT OF TAMPA TOWN THERE
THE VESSELS WERE UNLOADED AND THEIR CARGO CARRIED BY RAILWAY TO STONY
HILL AND ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY THE ENORMOUS MASS OF METAL WAS
DELIVERED AT ITS DESTINATION

IT WILL EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD THAT  FURNACES WERE NOT TOO MANY TO
MELT THESE  TONS OF IRON SIMULTANEOUSLY EACH OF THESE FURNACES
CONTAINED ABOUT  LBS OF METAL THEY HAD BEEN BUILT ON THE
MODEL OF THOSE USED FOR THE CASTING OF THE RODMAN GUN THEY WERE
TRAPEZOIDAL IN FORM WITH A HIGH ELLIPTICAL ARCH THE WARMING APPARATUS
AND THE CHIMNEY WERE PLACED AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THE FURNACE SO
THAT IT WAS EQUALLY HEATED THROUGHOUT THESE FURNACES BUILT OF
FIREPROOF BRICK WERE FILLED WITH COALGRATES AND A SOLE FOR THE BARS
OF IRON THIS SOLE INCLOSED AT AN ANGLE OF DEG ALLOWED THE METAL TO
FLOW INTO THE RECEIVINGTROUGHS FROM THENCE  CONVERGING TRENCHES
CARRIED IT DOWN TO THE CENTRAL WELL

THE DAY FOLLOWING THAT UPON WHICH THE WORKS OF MASONRY AND CASTING WERE
TERMINATED BARBICANE SET TO WORK UPON THE INTERIOR MOULD HIS OBJECT
NOW WAS TO RAISE IN THE CENTRE OF THE WELL WITH A COINCIDENT AXIS A
CYLINDER  FEET HIGH AND NINE IN DIAMETER TO EXACTLY FILL UP THE
SPACE RESERVED FOR THE BORE OF THE COLUMBIAD THIS CYLINDER WAS MADE OF
A MIXTURE OF CLAY AND SAND WITH THE ADDITION OF HAY AND STRAW THE
SPACE LEFT BETWEEN THE MOULD AND THE MASONRY WAS TO BE FILLED WITH THE
MOLTEN METAL WHICH WOULD THUS MAKE THE SIDES OF THE CANNON SIX FEET
THICK

THIS CYLINDER IN ORDER TO HAVE ITS EQUILIBRIUM MAINTAINED HAD TO BE
CONSOLIDATED WITH IRON BANDS AND FIXED AT INTERVALS BY MEANS OF
CROSSCLAMPS FASTENED INTO THE STONE LINING AFTER THE CASTING THESE
CLAMPS WOULD BE LOST IN THE BLOCK OF METAL WHICH WOULD NOT BE THE WORSE
FOR THEM

THIS OPERATION WAS COMPLETED ON THE TH OF JULY AND THE CASTING WAS
FIXED FOR THE TH

THE CASTING WILL BE A FINE CEREMONY SAID JT MASTON TO HIS FRIEND
BARBICANE

UNDOUBTEDLY ANSWERED BARBICANE BUT IT WILL NOT BE A PUBLIC ONE

WHAT YOU WILL NOT OPEN THE DOORS OF THE INCLOSURE TO ALL COMERS

CERTAINLY NOT THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD IS A DELICATE NOT TO SAY A
DANGEROUS OPERATION AND I PREFER THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE WITH CLOSED
DOORS WHEN THE PROJECTILE IS DISCHARGED YOU MAY HAVE A PUBLIC CEREMONY
IF YOU LIKE BUT TILL THEN NO

THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT THE OPERATION MIGHT BE ATTENDED WITH UNFORESEEN
DANGER WHICH A LARGE CONCOURSE OF SPECTATORS WOULD PREVENT BEING
AVERTED IT WAS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE COMPLETE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT NO
ONE WAS ADMITTED INTO THE INCLOSURE EXCEPT A DELEGATION OF MEMBERS OF
THE GUN CLUB WHO MADE THE VOYAGE TO TAMPA TOWN AMONG THEM WAS THE BRISK
BILSBY TOM HUNTER COLONEL BLOMSBERRY MAJOR ELPHINSTONE GENERAL
MORGAN AND TUTTI QUANTI TO WHOM THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD WAS A
PERSONAL BUSINESS JT MASTON CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THEIR CICERONE HE
DID NOT EXCUSE THEM ANY DETAIL HE LED THEM ABOUT EVERYWHERE THROUGH
THE MAGAZINES WORKSHOPS AMONGST THE MACHINES AND HE FORCED THEM TO
VISIT THE  FURNACES ONE AFTER THE OTHER AT THE END OF THE TH
VISIT THEY WERE RATHER SICK OF IT

THE CASTING WAS TO TAKE PLACE PRECISELY AT TWELVE OCLOCK THE EVENING
BEFORE EACH FURNACE HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH  LBS OF METAL IN BARS
DISPOSED CROSSWAY TO EACH OTHER SO THAT THE WARM AIR COULD CIRCULATE
FREELY AMONGST THEM SINCE EARLY MORNING THE  CHIMNEYS HAD BEEN
POURING FORTH VOLUMES OF FLAMES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE SOIL WAS
SHAKEN CONVULSIVELY THERE WERE AS MANY POUNDS OF COAL TO BE BURNT AS
METAL TO BE MELTED THERE WERE THEREFORE  TONS OF COAL THROWING
UP BEFORE THE SUN A THICK CURTAIN OF BLACK SMOKE

THE HEAT SOON BECAME UNBEARABLE IN THE CIRCLE OF FURNACES THE RAMBLING
OF WHICH RESEMBLED THE ROLLING OF THUNDER POWERFUL BELLOWS ADDED THEIR
CONTINUOUS BLASTS AND SATURATED THE INCANDESCENT FURNACES WITH OXYGEN

THE OPERATION OF CASTING IN ORDER TO SUCCEED MUST BE DONE RAPIDLY AT A
SIGNAL GIVEN BY A CANNONSHOT EACH FURNACE WAS TO POUR OUT THE LIQUID
IRON AND TO BE ENTIRELY EMPTIED

THESE ARRANGEMENTS MADE FOREMEN AND WORKMEN AWAITED THE PRECONCERTED
MOMENT WITH IMPATIENCE MIXED WITH EMOTION THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE
IN THE INCLOSURE AND EACH SUPERINTENDENT TOOK HIS PLACE NEAR THE
APERTURE OF THE RUN

BARBICANE AND HIS COLLEAGUES INSTALLED ON A NEIGHBOURING EMINENCE
ASSISTED AT THE OPERATION BEFORE THEM A CANNON WAS PLANTED READY TO BE
FIRED AS A SIGN FROM THE ENGINEER

A FEW MINUTES BEFORE TWELVE THE FIRST DROPS OF METAL BEGAN TO RUN THE
RESERVOIRS WERE GRADUALLY FILLED AND WHEN THE IRON WAS ALL IN A LIQUID
STATE IT WAS LEFT QUIET FOR SOME INSTANTS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE
SEPARATION OF FOREIGN SUBSTANCES

TWELVE OCLOCK STRUCK THE CANNON WAS SUDDENLY FIRED AND SHOT ITS FLAME
INTO THE AIR TWELVE HUNDRED TAPPINGHOLES WERE OPENED SIMULTANEOUSLY
AND TWELVE HUNDRED FIERY SERPENTS CREPT ALONG TWELVE HUNDRED TROUGHS
TOWARDS THE CENTRAL WELL ROLLING IN RINGS OF FIRE THERE THEY PLUNGED
WITH TERRIFIC NOISE DOWN A DEPTH OF  FEET IT WAS AN EXCITING AND
MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE THE GROUND TREMBLED WHILST THESE WAVES OF IRON
THROWING INTO THE SKY THEIR CLOUDS OF SMOKE EVAPORATED AT THE SAME TIME
THE HUMIDITY OF THE MOULD AND HURLED IT UPWARDS THROUGH THE VENTHOLES
OF THE MASONRY IN THE FORM OF IMPENETRABLE VAPOUR THESE ARTIFICIAL
CLOUDS UNROLLED THEIR THICK SPIRALS AS THEY WENT UP TO A HEIGHT OF 
FEET INTO THE AIR ANY RED INDIAN WANDERING UPON THE LIMITS OF THE
HORIZON MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IN THE FORMATION OF A NEW CRATER IN THE
HEART OF FLORIDA AND YET IT WAS NEITHER AN IRRUPTION NOR A TYPHOON
NOR A STORM NOR A STRUGGLE OF THE ELEMENTS NOR ONE OF THOSE TERRIBLE
PHENOMENA WHICH NATURE IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING NO MAN ALONE HAD
PRODUCED THOSE REDDISH VAPOURS THOSE GIGANTIC FLAMES WORTHY OF A
VOLCANO THOSE TREMENDOUS VIBRATIONS LIKE THE SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE
THOSE REVERBERATIONS RIVALS OF HURRICANES AND STORMS AND IT WAS HIS
HAND WHICH HURLED INTO AN ABYSS DUG BY HIMSELF A WHOLE NIAGARA OF
MOLTEN METAL




CHAPTER XVI

THE COLUMBIAD


HAD THE OPERATION OF CASTING SUCCEEDED PEOPLE WERE REDUCED TO MERE
CONJECTURE HOWEVER THERE WAS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE IN ITS SUCCESS
AS THE MOULD HAD ABSORBED THE ENTIRE MASS OF METAL LIQUEFIED IN THE
FURNACES STILL IT WAS NECESSARILY A LONG TIME IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CERTAIN

IN FACT WHEN MAJOR RODMAN CAST HIS CANNON OF  LBS IT TOOK NO
LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT TO COOL HOW LONG THEREFORE WOULD THE MONSTROUS
COLUMBIAD CROWNED WITH ITS CLOUDS OF VAPOUR AND GUARDED BY ITS INTENSE
HEAT BE KEPT FROM THE EYES OF ITS ADMIRERS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
ESTIMATE

THE IMPATIENCE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB WAS PUT TO A RUDE TEST
DURING THIS LAPSE OF TIME BUT IT COULD NOT BE HELPED JT MASTON WAS
NEARLY ROASTED THROUGH HIS ANXIETY A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE CASTING AN
IMMENSE COLUMN OF SMOKE WAS STILL SOARING TOWARDS THE SKY AND THE
GROUND BURNT THE SOLES OF THE FEET WITHIN A RADIUS OF  FEET ROUND THE
SUMMIT OF STONY HILL

THE DAYS WENT BY WEEKS FOLLOWED THEM THERE WERE NO MEANS OF COOLING
THE IMMENSE CYLINDER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO APPROACH IT THE MEMBERS OF
THE GUN CLUB WERE OBLIGED TO WAIT WITH WHAT PATIENCE THEY COULD MUSTER

HERE WE ARE AT THE TH OF AUGUST SAID JT MASTON ONE MORNING IT
WANTS HARDLY FOUR MONTHS TO THE ST OF DECEMBER THERE STILL REMAINS THE
INTERIOR MOULD TO BE TAKEN OUT AND THE COLUMBIAD TO BE LOADED WE NEVER
SHALL BE READY ONE CANNOT EVEN APPROACH THE CANNON WILL IT NEVER GET
COOL THAT WOULD BE A CRUEL DECEPTION

THEY TRIED TO CALM THE IMPATIENT SECRETARY WITHOUT SUCCEEDING BARBICANE
SAID NOTHING BUT HIS SILENCE COVERED SERIOUS IRRITATION TO SEE HIMSELF
STOPPED BY AN OBSTACLE THAT TIME ALONE COULD REMOVETIME AN ENEMY TO
BE FEARED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCESAND TO BE IN THE POWER OF AN ENEMY
WAS HARD FOR MEN OF WAR

HOWEVER DAILY OBSERVATIONS SHOWED A CERTAIN CHANGE IN THE STATE OF THE
GROUND TOWARDS THE TH OF AUGUST THE VAPOUR THROWN OFF HAD NOTABLY
DIMINISHED IN INTENSITY AND THICKNESS A FEW DAYS AFTER THE EARTH ONLY
EXHALED A SLIGHT PUFF OF SMOKE THE LAST BREATH OF THE MONSTER SHUT UP
IN ITS STONE TOMB BY DEGREES THE VIBRATIONS OF THE GROUND CEASED AND
THE CIRCLE OF HEAT CONTRACTED THE MOST IMPATIENT OF THE SPECTATORS
APPROACHED ONE DAY THEY GAINED TEN FEET THE NEXT TWENTY AND ON THE
ND OF AUGUST BARBICANE HIS COLLEAGUES AND THE ENGINEER COULD TAKE
THEIR PLACE ON THE CASTIRON SURFACE WHICH COVERED THE SUMMIT OF STONY
HILL CERTAINLY A VERY HEALTHY SPOT WHERE IT WAS NOT YET ALLOWED TO
HAVE COLD FEET

AT LAST CRIED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB WITH AN IMMENSE SIGH OF
SATISFACTION

THE WORKS WERE RESUMED THE SAME DAY THE EXTRACTION OF THE INTERIOR
MOULD WAS IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED WITH IN ORDER TO CLEAR OUT THE BORE
PICKAXES SPADES AND BORINGTOOLS WERE SET TO WORK WITHOUT
INTERMISSION THE CLAY AND SAND HAD BECOME EXCEEDINGLY HARD UNDER THE
ACTION OF THE HEAT BUT BY THE HELP OF MACHINES THEY CLEARED AWAY THE
MIXTURE STILL BURNING AT ITS CONTACT WITH THE IRON THE RUBBISH WAS
RAPIDLY CARTED AWAY ON THE RAILWAY AND THE WORK WAS DONE WITH SUCH
SPIRIT BARBICANES INTERVENTION WAS SO URGENT AND HIS ARGUMENTS
PRESENTED UNDER THE FORM OF DOLLARS CARRIED SO MUCH CONVICTION THAT ON
THE RD OF SEPTEMBER ALL TRACE OF THE MOULD HAD DISAPPEARED

THE OPERATION OF BORING WAS IMMEDIATELY BEGUN THE BORINGMACHINES WERE
SET UP WITHOUT DELAY AND A FEW WEEKS LATER THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE
IMMENSE TUBE WAS PERFECTLY CYLINDRICAL AND THE BORE HAD ACQUIRED A HIGH
POLISH

AT LAST ON THE ND OF SEPTEMBER LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER THE BARBICANE
COMMUNICATION THE ENORMOUS WEAPON RAISED BY MEANS OF DELICATE
INSTRUMENTS AND QUITE VERTICAL WAS READY FOR USE THERE WAS NOTHING
BUT THE MOON TO WAIT FOR BUT THEY WERE SURE SHE WOULD NOT FAIL

JT MASTONS JOY KNEW NO BOUNDS AND HE NEARLY HAD A FRIGHTFUL FALL
WHILST LOOKING DOWN THE TUBE OF  FEET WITHOUT COLONEL BLOMSBERRYS
RIGHT ARM WHICH HE HAD HAPPILY PRESERVED THE SECRETARY OF THE GUN
CLUB LIKE A MODERN EROSTATUS WOULD HAVE FOUND A GRAVE IN THE DEPTHS OF
THE COLUMBIAD

THE CANNON WAS THEN FINISHED THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY POSSIBLE DOUBT AS
TO ITS PERFECT EXECUTION SO ON THE TH OF OCTOBER CAPTAIN NICHOLL
CLEARED OFF HIS DEBT TO PRESIDENT BARBICANE WHO INSCRIBED IN HIS
RECEIPTCOLUMN A SUM OF  DOLLARS IT MAY BE BELIEVED THAT THE
CAPTAINS ANGER REACHED ITS HIGHEST PITCH AND COST HIM AN ILLNESS
STILL THERE WERE YET THREE BETS OF   AND  DOLLARS AND
IF HE ONLY GAINED  HIS BARGAIN WOULD NOT BE A BAD ONE THOUGH NOT
EXCELLENT BUT MONEY DID NOT ENTER INTO HIS CALCULATIONS AND THE
SUCCESS OBTAINED BY HIS RIVAL IN THE CASTING OF A CANNON AGAINST WHICH
IRON PLATES SIXTY FEET THICK WOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW
TO HIM

SINCE THE RD OF SEPTEMBER THE INCLOSURE ON STONY HILL HAD BEEN QUITE
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND THE CONCOURSE OF VISITORS WILL BE READILY
IMAGINED

IN FACT INNUMERABLE PEOPLE FROM ALL POINTS OF THE UNITED STATES FLOCKED
TO FLORIDA THE TOWN OF TAMPA WAS PRODIGIOUSLY INCREASED DURING THAT
YEAR CONSECRATED ENTIRELY TO THE WORKS OF THE GUN CLUB IT THEN
COMPRISED A POPULATION OF  SOULS AFTER HAVING SURROUNDED FORT
BROOKE IN A NETWORK OF STREETS IT WAS NOW BEING LENGTHENED OUT ON THAT
TONGUE OF LAND WHICH SEPARATED THE TWO HARBOURS OF ESPIRITUSANTO BAY
NEW QUARTERS NEW SQUARES AND A WHOLE FOREST OF HOUSES HAD GROWN UP IN
THESE FORMERLYDESERTED REGIONS UNDER THE HEAT OF THE AMERICAN SUN
COMPANIES WERE FORMED FOR THE ERECTION OF CHURCHES SCHOOLS PRIVATE
DWELLINGS AND IN LESS THAN A YEAR THE SIZE OF THE TOWN WAS INCREASED
TENFOLD

IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT YANKEES ARE BORN BUSINESS MEN EVERYWHERE THAT
DESTINY TAKES THEM FROM THE GLACIAL TO THE TORRID ZONE THEIR INSTINCT
FOR BUSINESS IS USEFULLY EXERCISED THAT IS WHY SIMPLE VISITORS TO
FLORIDA FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FOLLOWING THE OPERATIONS OF THE GUN CLUB
ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE INVOLVED IN COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS AS SOON AS
THEY WERE INSTALLED IN TAMPA TOWN THE VESSELS FREIGHTED FOR THE
TRANSPORT OF THE METAL AND THE WORKMEN HAD GIVEN UNPARALLELED ACTIVITY
TO THE PORT SOON OTHER VESSELS OF EVERY FORM AND TONNAGE FREIGHTED
WITH PROVISIONS AND MERCHANDISE PLOUGHED THE BAY AND THE TWO HARBOURS
VAST OFFICES OF SHIPBROKERS AND MERCHANTS WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE TOWN
AND THE SHIPPING GAZETTE EACH DAY PUBLISHED FRESH ARRIVALS IN THE PORT
OF TAMPA

WHILST ROADS WERE MULTIPLIED ROUND THE TOWN IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE
PRODIGIOUS INCREASE IN ITS POPULATION AND COMMERCE IT WAS JOINED BY
RAILWAY TO THE SOUTHERN STATES OF THE UNION ONE LINE OF RAILS CONNECTED
LA MOBILE TO PENSACOLA THE GREAT SOUTHERN MARITIME ARSENAL THENCE FROM
THAT IMPORTANT POINT IT RAN TO TALLAHASSEE THERE ALREADY EXISTED THERE
A SHORT LINE TWENTYONE MILES LONG TO SAINT MARKS ON THE SEASHORE IT
WAS THIS LOOPLINE THAT WAS PROLONGED AS FAR AS TAMPA TOWN AWAKENING IN
ITS PASSAGE THE DEAD OR SLEEPING PORTIONS OF CENTRAL FLORIDA THUS
TAMPA THANKS TO THESE MARVELS OF INDUSTRY DUE TO THE IDEA BORN ONE LINE
DAY IN THE BRAIN OF ONE MAN COULD TAKE AS ITS RIGHT THE AIRS OF A LARGE
TOWN THEY SURNAMED IT MOONCITY AND THE CAPITAL OF FLORIDA SUFFERED
AN ECLIPSE VISIBLE FROM ALL POINTS OF THE GLOBE

EVERY ONE WILL NOW UNDERSTAND WHY THE RIVALRY WAS SO GREAT BETWEEN TEXAS
AND FLORIDA AND THE IRRITATION OF THE TEXICANS WHEN THEY SAW THEIR
PRETENSIONS SET ASIDE BY THE GUN CLUB IN THEIR LONGSIGHTED SAGACITY
THEY HAD FORESEEN WHAT A COUNTRY MIGHT GAIN FROM THE EXPERIMENT
ATTEMPTED BY BARBICANE AND THE WEALTH THAT WOULD ACCOMPANY SUCH A
CANNONSHOT TEXAS LOST A VAST CENTRE OF COMMERCE RAILWAYS AND A
CONSIDERABLE INCREASE OF POPULATION ALL THESE ADVANTAGES HAD BEEN GIVEN
TO THAT MISERABLE FLORIDIAN PENINSULA THROWN LIKE A PIER BETWEEN THE
WAVES OF THE GULF AND THOSE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN BARBICANE THEREFORE
DIVIDED WITH GENERAL SANTAANNA THE TEXAN ANTIPATHY

HOWEVER THOUGH GIVEN UP TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FURY THE NEW
POPULATION OF TAMPA TOWN TOOK CARE NOT TO FORGET THE INTERESTING
OPERATIONS OF THE GUN CLUB ON THE CONTRARY THE LEAST DETAILS OF THE
ENTERPRISE EVERY BLOW OF THE PICKAXE INTERESTED THEM THERE WAS AN
INCESSANT FLOW OF PEOPLE TO AND FROM TAMPA TOWN TO STONY HILLA PERFECT
PROCESSION OR BETTER STILL A PILGRIMAGE

IT WAS ALREADY EASY TO FORESEE THAT THE DAY OF THE EXPERIMENT THE
CONCOURSE OF SPECTATORS WOULD BE COUNTED BY MILLIONS FOR THEY CAME
ALREADY FROM ALL POINTS OF THE EARTH TO THE NARROW PENINSULA EUROPE WAS
EMIGRATING TO AMERICA

BUT UNTIL THEN IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THE CURIOSITY OF THE NUMEROUS
ARRIVALS HAD ONLY BEEN MODERATELY SATISFIED MANY COUNTED UPON SEEING
THE CASTING WHO ONLY SAW THE SMOKE FROM IT THIS WAS NOT MUCH FOR HUNGRY
EYES BUT BARBICANE WOULD ALLOW NO ONE TO SEE THAT OPERATION THEREUPON
ENSUED GRUMBLING DISCONTENT AND MURMURS THEY BLAMED THE PRESIDENT FOR
WHAT THEY CONSIDERED DICTATORIAL CONDUCT HIS ACT WAS STIGMATISED AS
UNAMERICAN THERE WAS NEARLY A RIOT ROUND STONY HILL BUT BARBICANE
WAS NOT TO BE MOVED WHEN HOWEVER THE COLUMBIAD WAS QUITE FINISHED
THIS STATE OF CLOSED DOORS COULD NO LONGER BE KEPT UP BESIDES IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN IN BAD TASTE AND EVEN IMPRUDENT TO OFFEND PUBLIC OPINION
BARBICANE THEREFORE OPENED THE INCLOSURE TO ALL COMERS BUT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH HIS PRACTICAL CHARACTER HE DETERMINED TO COIN MONEY OUT
OF THE PUBLIC CURIOSITY

IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO EVEN BE ALLOWED TO SEE THIS IMMENSE
COLUMBIAD BUT TO DESCEND INTO ITS DEPTHS SEEMED TO THE AMERICANS THE
NE PLUS ULTRA OF EARTHLY FELICITY IN CONSEQUENCE THERE WAS NOT ONE
VISITOR WHO WAS NOT WILLING TO GIVE HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF VISITING THE
INTERIOR OF THIS METALLIC ABYSS BASKETS HUNG FROM STEAMCRANES ALLOWED
THEM TO SATISFY THEIR CURIOSITY IT BECAME A PERFECT MANIA WOMEN
CHILDREN AND OLD MEN ALL MADE IT THEIR BUSINESS TO PENETRATE THE
MYSTERIES OF THE COLOSSAL GUN THE PRICE FOR THE DESCENT WAS FIXED AT
FIVE DOLLARS A HEAD AND NOTWITHSTANDING THIS HIGH CHARGE DURING THE
TWO MONTHS THAT PRECEDED THE EXPERIMENT THE INFLUX OF VISITORS ALLOWED
THE GUN CLUB TO POCKET NEARLY  DOLLARS

IT NEED HARDLY BE SAID THAT THE FIRST VISITORS TO THE COLUMBIAD WERE THE
MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB THIS PRIVILEGE WAS JUSTLY ACCORDED TO THAT
ILLUSTRIOUS BODY THE CEREMONY OF RECEPTION TOOK PLACE ON THE TH OF
SEPTEMBER A BASKET OF HONOUR TOOK DOWN THE PRESIDENT JT MASTON
MAJOR ELPHINSTONE GENERAL MORGAN COLONEL BLOMSBERRY AND OTHER MEMBERS
OF THE GUN CLUB TEN IN ALL HOW HOT THEY WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT
LONG METAL TUBE THEY WERE NEARLY STIFLED BUT HOW DELIGHTFULHOW
EXQUISITE A TABLE HAD BEEN LAID FOR TEN ON THE MASSIVE STONE WHICH
FORMED THE BOTTOM OF THE COLUMBIAD AND WAS LIGHTED BY A JET OF ELECTRIC
LIGHT AS BRIGHT AS DAY ITSELF NUMEROUS EXQUISITE DISHES THAT SEEMED TO
DESCEND FROM HEAVEN WERE SUCCESSIVELY PLACED BEFORE THE GUESTS AND THE
RICHEST WINES OF FRANCE FLOWED PROFUSELY DURING THIS SPLENDID REPAST
GIVEN  FEET BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH

THE FESTIVAL WAS A GAY NOT TO SAY A NOISY ONE TOASTS WERE GIVEN AND
REPLIED TO THEY DRANK TO THE EARTH AND HER SATELLITE TO THE GUN CLUB
THE UNION THE MOON DIANA PHOEBE SELENE THE PEACEFUL COURIER OF THE
NIGHT ALL THE HURRAHS CARRIED UP BY THE SONOROUS WAVES OF THE IMMENSE
ACOUSTIC TUBE REACHED ITS MOUTH WITH A NOISE OF THUNDER THEN THE
MULTITUDE ROUND STONY HILL HEARTILY UNITED THEIR SHOUTS TO THOSE OF THE
TEN REVELLERS HIDDEN FROM SIGHT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE GIGANTIC COLUMBIAD

JT MASTON COULD CONTAIN HIMSELF NO LONGER WHETHER HE SHOUTED OR ATE
GESTICULATED OR TALKED MOST WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE ANY WAY HE
WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN UP HIS PLACE FOR AN EMPIRE NOT EVEN IF THE
CANNONLOADED PRIMED AND FIRED AT THAT VERY MOMENTWERE TO BLOW HIM
IN PIECES INTO THE PLANETARY UNIVERSE




CHAPTER XVII

A TELEGRAM


THE GREAT WORK UNDERTAKEN BY THE GUN CLUB WAS NOW VIRTUALLY ENDED AND
YET TWO MONTHS WOULD STILL ELAPSE BEFORE THE DAY THE PROJECTILE WOULD
START FOR THE MOON THESE TWO MONTHS WOULD SEEM AS LONG AS TWO YEARS TO
THE UNIVERSAL IMPATIENCE UNTIL THEN THE SMALLEST DETAILS OF EACH
OPERATION HAD APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS EVERY DAY AND WERE EAGERLY
DEVOURED BY THE PUBLIC BUT NOW IT WAS TO BE FEARED THAT THIS INTEREST
DIVIDEND WOULD BE MUCH DIMINISHED AND EVERY ONE WAS AFRAID OF NO
LONGER RECEIVING HIS DAILY SHARE OF EMOTIONS

THEY WERE ALL AGREEABLY DISAPPOINTED THE MOST UNEXPECTED
EXTRAORDINARY INCREDIBLE AND IMPROBABLE INCIDENT HAPPENED IN TIME TO
KEEP UP THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH

ON SEPTEMBER TH AT  PM A TELEGRAM TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE
ATLANTIC CABLE ARRIVED AT TAMPA TOWN FOR PRESIDENT BARBICANE

HE TORE OPEN THE ENVELOPE AND READ THE MESSAGE AND NOTWITHSTANDING HIS
GREAT SELFCONTROL HIS LIPS GREW PALE AND HIS EYES DIM AS HE READ THE
TELEGRAM

THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THE MESSAGE STORED IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE
GUN CLUB

FRANCE PARIS

SEPTEMBER TH  AM

BARBICANE TAMPA TOWN FLORIDA UNITED STATES

SUBSTITUTE A CYLINDROCONICAL PROJECTILE FOR YOUR SPHERICAL SHELL
SHALL GO INSIDE SHALL ARRIVE BY STEAMER ATLANTA

MICHEL ARDAN




CHAPTER XVIII

THE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA


IF THIS WONDERFUL NEWS INSTEAD OF COMING BY TELEGRAPH HAD SIMPLY
ARRIVED BY POST AND IN A SEALED ENVELOPEIF THE FRENCH IRISH
NEWFOUNDLAND AND AMERICAN TELEGRAPH CLERKS HAD NOT NECESSARILY BEEN
ACQUAINTED WITH ITBARBICANE WOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT HE
WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SILENT ABOUT IT FOR PRUDENCE SAKE AND IN ORDER
NOT TO THROW DISCREDIT ON HIS WORK THIS TELEGRAM MIGHT BE A PRACTICAL
JOKE ESPECIALLY AS IT CAME FROM A FRENCHMAN WHAT PROBABILITY COULD
THERE BE THAT ANY MAN SHOULD CONCEIVE THE IDEA OF SUCH A JOURNEY AND IF
THE MAN DID EXIST WAS HE NOT A MADMAN WHO WOULD HAVE TO BE INCLOSED IN A
STRAITWAISTCOAT INSTEAD OF IN A CANNONBALL

BUT THE MESSAGE WAS KNOWN AND MICHEL ARDANS PROPOSITION WAS ALREADY
ALL OVER THE STATES OF THE UNION SO BARBICANE HAD NO REASON FOR
SILENCE HE THEREFORE CALLED TOGETHER HIS COLLEAGUES THEN IN TAMPA TOWN
AND WITHOUT SHOWING WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT OR SAYING A WORD ABOUT THE
DEGREE OF CREDIBILITY THE TELEGRAM DESERVED HE READ COLDLY THE LACONIC
TEXT

NOT POSSIBLEUNHEARD OFTHEY ARE LAUGHING AT
USRIDICULOUSABSURD EVERY SORT OF EXPRESSION FOR DOUBT
INCREDULITY AND FOLLY WAS HEARD FOR SOME MINUTES WITH ACCOMPANIMENT OF
APPROPRIATE GESTURES JT MASTON ALONE UTTERED THE WORDS

THATS AN IDEA HE EXCLAIMED

YES ANSWERED THE MAJOR BUT IF PEOPLE HAVE SUCH IDEAS AS THAT THEY
OUGHT NOT TO THINK OF PUTTING THEM INTO EXECUTION

WHY NOT QUICKLY ANSWERED THE SECRETARY OF THE GUN CLUB READY FOR AN
ARGUMENT BUT THE SUBJECT WAS LET DROP

IN THE MEANTIME MICHEL ARDANS NAME WAS ALREADY GOING ABOUT TAMPA TOWN
STRANGERS AND NATIVES TALKED AND JOKED TOGETHER NOT ABOUT THE
EUROPEANEVIDENTLY A MYTHICAL PERSONAGEBUT ABOUT JT MASTON WHO HAD
THE FOLLY TO BELIEVE IN HIS EXISTENCE WHEN BARBICANE PROPOSED TO SEND A
PROJECTILE TO THE MOON EVERY ONE THOUGHT THE ENTERPRISE NATURAL AND
PRACTICABLEA SIMPLE AFFAIR OF BALLISTICS BUT THAT A REASONABLE BEING
SHOULD OFFER TO GO THE JOURNEY INSIDE THE PROJECTILE WAS A FARCE OR TO
USE A FAMILIAR AMERICANISM IT WAS ALL HUMBUG

THIS LAUGHTER LASTED TILL EVENING THROUGHOUT THE UNION AN UNUSUAL THING
IN A COUNTRY WHERE ANY IMPOSSIBLE ENTERPRISE FINDS ADEPTS AND PARTISANS

STILL MICHEL ARDANS PROPOSITION DID NOT FAIL TO AWAKEN A CERTAIN
EMOTION IN MANY MINDS THEY HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING HOW MANY
THINGS DENIED ONE DAY HAD BECOME REALITIES THE NEXT WHY SHOULD NOT THIS
JOURNEY BE ACCOMPLISHED ONE DAY OR ANOTHER BUT ANY WAY THE MAN WHO
WOULD RUN SUCH A RISK MUST BE A MADMAN AND CERTAINLY AS HIS PROJECT
COULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY HE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO BE QUIET
ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF TROUBLING A WHOLE POPULATION WITH SUCH RIDICULOUS
TRASH

BUT FIRST OF ALL DID THIS PERSONAGE REALLY EXIST THAT WAS THE GREAT
QUESTION THE NAME OF MICHEL ARDAN WAS NOT ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN IN
AMERICA IT BELONGED TO A EUROPEAN MUCH TALKED ABOUT FOR HIS AUDACIOUS
ENTERPRISES THEN THE TELEGRAM SENT ALL ACROSS THE DEPTHS OF THE
ATLANTIC THE DESIGNATION OF THE SHIP UPON WHICH THE FRENCHMAN HAD
DECLARED HE HAD TAKEN HIS PASSAGE THE DATE ASSIGNED FOR HIS
ARRIVALALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES GAVE TO THE PROPOSITION A CERTAIN AIR
OF PROBABILITY THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DISBURDEN THEIR MINDS ABOUT IT
SOON THESE ISOLATED INDIVIDUALS FORMED INTO GROUPS THE GROUPS BECAME
CONDENSED UNDER THE ACTION OF CURIOSITY LIKE ATOMS BY VIRTUE OF
MOLECULAR ATTRACTION AND THE RESULT WAS A COMPACT CROWD GOING TOWARDS
PRESIDENT BARBICANES DWELLING

THE PRESIDENT SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF THE MESSAGE HAD NOT SAID WHAT HE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT HE HAD LET JT MASTON EXPRESS HIS OPINIONS WITHOUT
MANIFESTING EITHER APPROBATION OR BLAME HE KEPT QUIET PROPOSING TO
AWAIT EVENTS BUT HE HAD NOT TAKEN PUBLIC IMPATIENCE INTO CONSIDERATION
AND WAS NOT VERY PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF THE POPULATION OF TAMPA TOWN
ASSEMBLED UNDER HIS WINDOWS MURMURS CRIES AND VOCIFERATIONS SOON
FORCED HIM TO APPEAR IT WILL BE SEEN THAT HE HAD ALL THE DISAGREEABLES
AS WELL AS THE DUTIES OF A PUBLIC MAN

HE THEREFORE APPEARED SILENCE WAS MADE AND A CITIZEN ASKED HIM THE
FOLLOWING QUESTIONIS THE PERSON DESIGNATED IN THE TELEGRAM AS MICHEL
ARDAN ON HIS WAY TO AMERICA OR NOT

GENTLEMEN ANSWERED BARBICANE I KNOW NO MORE THAN YOU

WE MUST GET TO KNOW EXCLAIMED SOME IMPATIENT VOICES

TIME WILL INFORM US ANSWERED THE PRESIDENT COLDLY

TIME HAS NO RIGHT TO KEEP A WHOLE COUNTRY IN SUSPENSE ANSWERED THE
ORATOR HAVE YOU ALTERED YOUR PLANS FOR THE PROJECTILE AS THE TELEGRAM
DEMANDED

NOT YET GENTLEMEN BUT YOU ARE RIGHT WE MUST HAVE RECOURSE TO THE
TELEGRAPH THAT HAS CAUSED ALL THIS EMOTION

TO THE TELEGRAPHOFFICE CRIED THE CROWD

BARBICANE DESCENDED INTO THE STREET AND HEADING THE IMMENSE
ASSEMBLAGE HE WENT TOWARDS THE TELEGRAPHOFFICE

A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS A TELEGRAM WAS ON ITS WAY TO THE UNDERWRITERS
AT LIVERPOOL ASKING FOR AN ANSWER TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS

WHAT SORT OF VESSEL IS THE ATLANTA WHEN DID SHE LEAVE EUROPE HAD
SHE A FRENCHMAN NAMED MICHEL ARDAN ON BOARD

TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS BARBICANE RECEIVED SUCH PRECISE INFORMATION THAT
DOUBT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE

THE STEAMER ATLANTA FROM LIVERPOOL SET SAIL ON OCTOBER ND FOR
TAMPA TOWN HAVING ON BOARD A FRENCHMAN INSCRIBED IN THE PASSENGERS
BOOK AS MICHEL ARDAN

AT THIS CONFIRMATION OF THE FIRST TELEGRAM THE EYES OF THE PRESIDENT
WERE LIGHTED UP WITH A SUDDEN FLAME HE CLENCHED HIS HANDS AND WAS
HEARD TO MUTTER

IT IS TRUE THEN IT IS POSSIBLE THEN THE FRENCHMAN DOES EXIST AND
IN A FORTNIGHT HE WILL BE HERE BUT HE IS A MADMAN I NEVER CAN
CONSENT

AND YET THE VERY SAME EVENING HE WROTE TO THE FIRM OF BREADWILL AND CO
BEGGING THEM TO SUSPEND THE CASTING OF THE PROJECTILE UNTIL FRESH
ORDERS

NOW HOW CAN THE EMOTION BE DESCRIBED WHICH TOOK POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE
OF AMERICA THE EFFECT OF THE BARBICANE PROPOSITION WAS SURPASSED
TENFOLD WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE UNION SAID THE WAY THEY ACCEPTED
THE NEWS AND HOW THEY CHANTED THE ARRIVAL OF THIS HERO FROM THE OLD
CONTINENT HOW TO DEPICT THE FEVERISH AGITATION IN WHICH EVERY ONE
LIVED COUNTING THE HOURS MINUTES AND SECONDS HOW TO GIVE EVEN A
FEEBLE IDEA OF THE EFFECT OF ONE IDEA UPON SO MANY HEADS HOW TO SHOW
EVERY OCCUPATION BEING GIVEN UP FOR A SINGLE PREOCCUPATION WORK
STOPPED COMMERCE SUSPENDED VESSELS READY TO START WAITING IN THE
PORTS SO AS NOT TO MISS THE ARRIVAL OF THE ATLANTA EVERY SPECIES OF
CONVEYANCE ARRIVING FULL AND RETURNING EMPTY THE BAY OF ESPIRITUSANTO
INCESSANTLY PLOUGHED BY STEAMERS PACKETBOATS PLEASUREYACHTS AND
FLYBOATS OF ALL DIMENSIONS HOW TO DENOMINATE IN NUMBERS THE THOUSANDS
OF CURIOUS PEOPLE WHO IN A FORTNIGHT INCREASED THE POPULATION OF TAMPA
TOWN FOURFOLD AND WERE OBLIGED TO ENCAMP UNDER TENTS LIKE AN ARMY IN
CAMPAIGNALL THIS IS A TASK ABOVE HUMAN FORCE AND COULD NOT BE
UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT RASHNESS

AT  AM ON THE TH OF OCTOBER THE SEMAPHORES OF THE BAHAMA CHANNEL
SIGNALLED THICK SMOKE ON THE HORIZON TWO HOURS LATER A LARGE STEAMER
EXCHANGED SIGNALS WITH THEM THE NAME ATLANTA WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT TO
TAMPA TOWN AT  PM THE ENGLISH VESSEL ENTERED THE BAY OF
ESPIRITUSANTO AT  PM SHE PASSED THE ENTRANCE TO HILLISBORO HARBOUR
AND AT  PM WEIGHED ANCHOR IN THE PORT OF TAMPA TOWN

THE ANCHOR HAD NOT REACHED ITS SANDY BED BEFORE  VESSELS SURROUNDED
THE ATLANTA AND THE STEAMER WAS TAKEN BY ASSAULT BARBICANE WAS THE
FIRST ON DECK AND IN A VOICE THE EMOTION OF WHICH HE TRIED IN VAIN TO
SUPPRESS

MICHEL ARDAN HE EXCLAIMED

PRESENT ANSWERED AN INDIVIDUAL MOUNTED ON THE POOP

BARBICANE WITH HIS ARMS CROSSED QUESTIONING EYES AND SILENT MOUTH
LOOKED FIXEDLY AT THE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA

HE WAS A MAN FORTYTWO YEARS OF AGE TALL BUT ALREADY RATHER STOOPING
LIKE CARYATIDES WHICH SUPPORT BALCONIES ON THEIR SHOULDERS HIS LARGE
HEAD SHOOK EVERY NOW AND THEN A SHOCK OF RED HAIR LIKE A LIONS MANE A
SHORT FACE WIDE FOREHEAD A MOUSTACHE BRISTLING LIKE A CATS WHISKERS
AND LITTLE BUNCHES OF YELLOW HAIR ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEEKS ROUND AND
RATHER WILDLOOKING SHORTSIGHTED EYES COMPLETED THIS EMINENTLY FELINE
PHYSIOGNOMY BUT THE NOSE WAS BOLDLY CUT THE MOUTH PARTICULARLY HUMANE
THE FOREHEAD HIGH INTELLIGENT AND PLOUGHED LIKE A FIELD THAT WAS NEVER
ALLOWED TO REMAIN FALLOW LASTLY A MUSCULAR BODY WELL POISED ON LONG
LIMBS MUSCULAR ARMS POWERFUL AND WELLSET LEVERS AND A DECIDED GAIT
MADE A SOLIDLY BUILT FELLOW OF THIS EUROPEAN RATHER WROUGHT THAN
CAST TO BORROW ONE OF HIS EXPRESSIONS FROM METALLURGIC ART

THE DISCIPLES OF LAVATER OR GRATIOLET WOULD HAVE EASILY DECIPHERED IN
THE CRANIUM AND PHYSIOGNOMY OF THIS PERSONAGE INDISPUTABLE SIGNS OF
COMBATIVITYTHAT IS TO SAY OF COURAGE IN DANGER AND TENDENCY TO
OVERCOME OBSTACLES THOSE OF BENEVOLENCE AND A BELIEF IN THE
MARVELLOUS AN INSTINCT THAT MAKES MANY NATURES DWELL MUCH ON SUPERHUMAN
THINGS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE BUMPS OF ACQUISIVITY THE NEED OF
POSSESSING AND ACQUIRING WERE ABSOLUTELY WANTING

TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THE PHYSICAL TYPE OF THE PASSENGER OF
THE ATLANTA HIS GARMENTS WIDE LOOSE AND FLOWING OPEN CRAVAT WIDE
COLLAR AND CUFFS ALWAYS UNBUTTONED THROUGH WHICH CAME NERVOUS HANDS
PEOPLE FELT THAT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF WINTER AND DANGERS THAT MAN WAS
NEVER COLD

ON THE DECK OF THE STEAMER AMONGST THE CROWD HE BUSTLED ABOUT NEVER
STILL FOR A MOMENT DRAGGING HIS ANCHORS IN NAUTICAL SPEECH
GESTICULATING MAKING FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY AND BITING HIS NAILS
NERVOUSLY HE WAS ONE OF THOSE ORIGINAL BEINGS WHOM THE CREATOR INVENTS
IN A MOMENT OF FANTASY AND OF WHOM HE IMMEDIATELY BREAKS THE CAST

IN FACT THE CHARACTER OF MICHEL ARDAN OFFERED A LARGE FIELD FOR
PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS THIS ASTONISHING MAN LIVED IN A PERPETUAL
DISPOSITION TO HYPERBOLE AND HAD NOT YET PASSED THE AGE OF
SUPERLATIVES OBJECTS DEPICTED THEMSELVES ON THE RETINA OF HIS EYE WITH
EXAGGERATED DIMENSIONS FROM THENCE AN ASSOCIATION OF GIGANTIC IDEAS HE
SAW EVERYTHING ON A LARGE SCALE EXCEPT DIFFICULTIES AND MEN

HE WAS BESIDES OF A LUXURIANT NATURE AN ARTIST BY INSTINCT AND WITTY
FELLOW HE LOVED ARGUMENTS AD HOMINEM AND DEFENDED THE WEAK SIDE
TOOTH AND NAIL

AMONGST OTHER PECULIARITIES HE GAVE HIMSELF OUT AS SUBLIMELY IGNORANT
LIKE SHAKSPEARE AND PROFESSED SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR ALL SAVANTS
PEOPLE SAID HE WHO ONLY SCORE OUR POINTS HE WAS IN SHORT A
BOHEMIAN OF THE COUNTRY OF BRAINS ADVENTUROUS BUT NOT AN ADVENTURER A
HAREBRAINED FELLOW A PHAETON RUNNING AWAY WITH THE HORSES OF THE SUN A
KIND OF ICARUS WITH RELAYS OF WINGS HE HAD A WONDERFUL FACILITY FOR
GETTING INTO SCRAPES AND AN EQUALLY WONDERFUL FACILITY FOR GETTING OUT
OF THEM AGAIN FALLING ON HIS FEET LIKE A CAT

IN SHORT HIS MOTTO WAS WHATEVER IT MAY COST AND THE LOVE OF THE
IMPOSSIBLE HIS RULING PASSION ACCORDING TO POPES FINE EXPRESSION

BUT THIS ENTERPRISING FELLOW HAD THE DEFECTS OF HIS QUALITIES WHO RISKS
NOTHING WINS NOTHING IT IS SAID ARDAN OFTEN RISKED MUCH AND GOT
NOTHING HE WAS PERFECTLY DISINTERESTED AND CHIVALRIC HE WOULD NOT HAVE
SIGNED THE DEATHWARRANT OF HIS WORST ENEMY AND WOULD HAVE SOLD HIMSELF
INTO SLAVERY TO REDEEM A NEGRO

IN FRANCE AND EUROPE EVERYBODY KNEW THIS BRILLIANT BUSTLING PERSON DID
HE NOT GET TALKED OF CEASELESSLY BY THE HUNDRED VOICES OF FAME HOARSE
IN HIS SERVICE DID HE NOT LIVE IN A GLASS HOUSE TAKING THE ENTIRE
UNIVERSE AS CONFIDANT OF HIS MOST INTIMATE SECRETS BUT HE ALSO
POSSESSED AN ADMIRABLE COLLECTION OF ENEMIES AMONGST THOSE HE HAD CUFFED
AND WOUNDED WHILST USING HIS ELBOWS TO MAKE A PASSAGE IN THE CROWD

STILL HE WAS GENERALLY LIKED AND TREATED LIKE A SPOILED CHILD EVERY ONE
WAS INTERESTED IN HIS BOLD ENTERPRISES AND FOLLOWED THEM WITH UNEASY
MIND HE WAS KNOWN TO BE SO IMPRUDENT WHEN SOME FRIEND WISHED TO STOP
HIM BY PREDICTING AN APPROACHING CATASTROPHE THE FOREST IS ONLY BURNT
BY ITS OWN TREES HE ANSWERED WITH AN AMIABLE SMILE NOT KNOWING THAT
HE WAS QUOTING THE PRETTIEST OF ARABIAN PROVERBS

SUCH WAS THE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA ALWAYS IN A BUSTLE ALWAYS
BOILING UNDER THE ACTION OF INWARD FIRE ALWAYS MOVED NOT BY WHAT HE
HAD COME TO DO IN AMERICAHE DID NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT ITBUT ON
ACCOUNT OF HIS FEVERISH ORGANISATION IF EVER INDIVIDUALS OFFERED A
STRIKING CONTRAST THEY WERE THE FRENCHMAN MICHEL ARDAN AND THE YANKEE
BARBICANE BOTH HOWEVER ENTERPRISING BOLD AND AUDACIOUS EACH IN HIS
OWN WAY

BARBICANES CONTEMPLATION OF HIS RIVAL WAS QUICKLY INTERRUPTED BY THE
CHEERS OF THE CROWD THESE CRIES BECAME EVEN SO FRANTIC AND THE
ENTHUSIASM TOOK SUCH A PERSONAL FORM THAT MICHEL ARDAN AFTER HAVING
SHAKEN A THOUSAND HANDS IN WHICH HE NEARLY LEFT HIS TEN FINGERS WAS
OBLIGED TO TAKE REFUGE IN HIS CABIN

BARBICANE FOLLOWED HIM WITHOUT HAVING UTTERED A WORD

YOU ARE BARBICANE MICHEL ARDAN ASKED HIM AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE
AND IN THE SAME TONE AS HE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO A FRIEND OF TWENTY
YEARS STANDING

YES ANSWERED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB

WELL GOOD MORNING BARBICANE HOW ARE YOU VERY WELL THATS RIGHT
THATS RIGHT

THEN SAID BARBICANE WITHOUT FURTHER PRELIMINARY YOU HAVE DECIDED
TO GO

QUITE DECIDED

NOTHING WILL STOP YOU

NOTHING HAVE YOU ALTERED YOUR PROJECTILE AS I TOLD YOU IN MY MESSAGE

I WAITED TILL YOU CAME BUT ASKED BARBICANE INSISTING ONCE MORE
YOU HAVE QUITE REFLECTED

REFLECTED HAVE I ANY TIME TO LOSE I FIND THE OCCASION TO GO FOR A
TRIP TO THE MOON I PROFIT BY IT AND THAT IS ALL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
DOES NOT WANT SO MUCH REFLECTION

BARBICANE LOOKED EAGERLY AT THE MAN WHO SPOKE OF HIS PROJECT OF JOURNEY
WITH SO MUCH CARELESSNESS AND WITH SUCH ABSENCE OF ANXIETY

BUT AT LEAST HE SAID YOU HAVE SOME PLAN SOME MEANS OF EXECUTION

EXCELLENT MEANS BUT ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU ONE THING I LIKE TO SAY MY
SAY ONCE AND FOR ALL AND TO EVERYBODY AND TO HEAR NO MORE ABOUT IT
THEN UNLESS YOU CAN THINK OF SOMETHING BETTER CALL TOGETHER YOUR
FRIENDS YOUR COLLEAGUES ALL THE TOWN ALL FLORIDA ALL AMERICA IF YOU
LIKE AND TOMORROW I SHALL BE READY TO STATE MY MEANS OF EXECUTION AND
ANSWER ANY OBJECTIONS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE WILL THAT DO

YES THAT WILL DO ANSWERED BARBICANE

WHEREUPON THE PRESIDENT LEFT THE CABIN AND TOLD THE CROWD ABOUT MICHEL
ARDANS PROPOSITION HIS WORDS WERE RECEIVED WITH GREAT DEMONSTRATIONS
OF JOY THAT CUT SHORT ALL DIFFICULTIES THE NEXT DAY EVERY ONE COULD
CONTEMPLATE THE EUROPEAN HERO AT THEIR EASE STILL SOME OF THE MOST
OBSTINATE SPECTATORS WOULD NOT LEAVE THE DECK OF THE ATLANTA THEY
PASSED THE NIGHT ON BOARD AMONGST OTHERS JT MASTON HAD SCREWED HIS
STEEL HOOK INTO THE COMBING OF THE POOP AND IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE
CAPSTAN TO GET IT OUT AGAIN

HE IS A HERO A HERO CRIED HE IN EVERY TONE AND WE ARE ONLY OLD
WOMEN COMPARED TO THAT EUROPEAN

AS TO THE PRESIDENT AFTER HAVING REQUESTED THE SPECTATORS TO WITHDRAW
HE REENTERED THE PASSENGERS CABIN AND DID NOT LEAVE IT TILL THE BELL
OF THE STEAMER RANG OUT THE MIDNIGHT QUARTER

BUT THEN THE TWO RIVALS IN POPULARITY SHOOK EACH OTHER WARMLY BY THE
HAND AND SEPARATED FRIENDS




CHAPTER XIX

A MEETING


THE NEXT DAY THE SUN DID NOT RISE EARLY ENOUGH TO SATISFY PUBLIC
IMPATIENCE BARBICANE FEARING THAT INDISCREET QUESTIONS WOULD BE PUT TO
MICHEL ARDAN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE REDUCED HIS AUDITORS TO A SMALL NUMBER
OF ADEPTS TO HIS COLLEAGUES FOR INSTANCE BUT IT WAS AS EASY AS TO DAM
UP THE FALLS AT NIAGARA HE WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE HIS
PROJECT AND LET HIS FRIEND RUN ALL THE RISKS OF A PUBLIC LECTURE THE
NEW TOWN HALL OF TAMPA TOWN NOTWITHSTANDING ITS COLOSSAL DIMENSIONS
WAS CONSIDERED INSUFFICIENT FOR THE OCCASION WHICH HAD ASSUMED THE
PROPORTIONS OF A PUBLIC MEETING

THE PLACE CHOSEN WAS A VAST PLAIN SITUATED OUTSIDE THE TOWN IN A FEW
HOURS THEY SUCCEEDED IN SHELTERING IT FROM THE RAYS OF THE SUN THE
SHIPS OF THE PORT RICH IN CANVAS FURNISHED THE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
FOR A COLOSSAL TENT SOON AN IMMENSE SKY OF CLOTH WAS SPREAD OVER THE
CALCINED PLAIN AND DEFENDED IT AGAINST THE HEAT OF THE DAY THERE
 PERSONS STOOD AND BRAVED A STIFLING TEMPERATURE FOR SEVERAL
HOURS WHILST AWAITING THE FRENCHMANS ARRIVAL OF THAT CROWD OF
SPECTATORS ONETHIRD ALONE COULD SEE AND HEAR A SECOND THIRD SAW BADLY
AND DID NOT HEAR AS TO THE REMAINING THIRD IT NEITHER HEARD NOR SAW
THOUGH IT WAS NOT THE LEAST EAGER TO APPLAUD

AT THREE OCLOCK MICHEL ARDAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE ACCOMPANIED BY THE
PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB HE GAVE HIS RIGHT ARM TO PRESIDENT
BARBICANE AND HIS LEFT TO JT MASTON MORE RADIANT THAN THE MIDDAY
SUN AND NEARLY AS RUDDY

ARDAN MOUNTED THE PLATFORM FROM WHICH HIS EYES EXTENDED OVER A FOREST
OF BLACK HATS HE DID NOT SEEM IN THE LEAST EMBARRASSED HE DID NOT
POSE HE WAS AT HOME THERE GAY FAMILIAR AND AMIABLE TO THE CHEERS
THAT GREETED HIM HE ANSWERED BY A GRACIOUS BOW THEN WITH HIS HAND ASKED
FOR SILENCE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN ENGLISH AND EXPRESSED HIMSELF VERY
CORRECTLY IN THESE TERMS

GENTLEMEN SAID HE ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY WARM I INTEND TO KEEP YOU A
FEW MINUTES TO GIVE YOU SOME EXPLANATION OF THE PROJECTS WHICH HAVE
APPEARED TO INTEREST YOU I AM NEITHER AN ORATOR NOR A SAVANT AND I
DID NOT COUNT UPON HAVING TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC BUT MY FRIEND BARBICANE
TELLS ME IT WOULD GIVE YOU PLEASURE SO I DO IT THEN LISTEN TO ME WITH
YOUR  EARS AND PLEASE TO EXCUSE THE FAULTS OF THE ORATOR

THIS UNCEREMONIOUS BEGINNING WAS MUCH ADMIRED BY THE AUDIENCE WHO
EXPRESSED THEIR SATISFACTION BY AN IMMENSE MURMUR OF APPLAUSE

GENTLEMEN SAID HE NO MARK OF APPROBATION OR DISSENT IS PROHIBITED
THAT SETTLED I CONTINUE AND FIRST OF ALL DO NOT FORGET THAT YOU HAVE
TO DO WITH AN IGNORANT MAN BUT HIS IGNORANCE GOES FAR ENOUGH TO IGNORE
DIFFICULTIES IT HAS THEREFORE APPEARED A SIMPLE NATURAL AND EASY
THING TO HIM TO TAKE HIS PASSAGE IN A PROJECTILE AND TO START FOR THE
MOON THAT JOURNEY WOULD BE MADE SOONER OR LATER AND AS TO THE MODE OF
LOCOMOTION ADOPTED IT SIMPLY FOLLOWS THE LAW OF PROGRESS MAN BEGAN BY
TRAVELLING ON ALL FOURS THEN ONE FINE DAY HE WENT ON TWO FEET THEN IN
A CART THEN IN A COACH THEN ON A RAILWAY WELL THE PROJECTILE IS THE
CARRIAGE OF THE FUTURE AND TO SPEAK THE TRUTH PLANETS ARE ONLY
PROJECTILES SIMPLE CANNONBALLS HURLED BY THE HAND OF THE CREATOR BUT
TO RETURN TO OUR VEHICLE SOME OF YOU GENTLEMEN MAY THINK THAT THE
SPEED IT WILL TRAVEL AT IS EXCESSIVENOTHING OF THE KIND ALL THE
PLANETS GO FASTER AND THE EARTH ITSELF IN ITS MOVEMENT ROUND THE SUN
CARRIES US ALONG THREE TIMES AS FAST HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES ONLY I ASK
YOUR PERMISSION TO EXPRESS MYSELF IN LEAGUES FOR AMERICAN MEASURES ARE
NOT VERY FAMILIAR TO ME AND I FEAR GETTING MUDDLED IN MY CALCULATIONS

THE DEMAND APPEARED QUITE SIMPLE AND OFFERED NO DIFFICULTY THE ORATOR
RESUMED HIS SPEECH

THE FOLLOWING GENTLEMEN IS THE SPEED OF THE DIFFERENT PLANETS I AM
OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING MY IGNORANCE I KNOW THIS
SMALL ASTRONOMICAL DETAIL EXACTLY BUT IN TWO MINUTES YOU WILL BE AS
LEARNED AS I LEARN THEN THAT NEPTUNE GOES AT THE RATE OF 
LEAGUES AN HOUR URANUS  SATURN  JUPITER  MARS
 THE EARTH  VENUS  MERCURY  SOME COMETS
 LEAGUES IN THEIR PERIHELION AS TO US VERITABLE IDLERS PEOPLE
IN NO HURRY OUR SPEED DOES NOT EXCEED  LEAGUES AND IT WILL GO ON
DECREASING I ASK YOU IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO WONDER AT AND IF IT IS
NOT EVIDENT THAT IT WILL BE SURPASSED SOME DAY BY STILL GREATER SPEEDS
OF WHICH LIGHT OR ELECTRICITY WILL PROBABLY BE THE MECHANICAL AGENTS

NO ONE SEEMED TO DOUBT THIS AFFIRMATION

DEAR HEARERS HE RESUMED ACCORDING TO CERTAIN NARROW MINDSTHAT IS
THE BEST QUALIFICATION FOR THEMHUMANITY IS INCLOSED IN A POPILIUS
CIRCLE WHICH IT CANNOT BREAK OPEN AND IS CONDEMNED TO VEGETATE UPON
THIS GLOBE WITHOUT EVER FLYING TOWARDS THE PLANETARY SHORES NOTHING OF
THE KIND WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON WE SHALL GO TO THE PLANETS WE SHALL
GO TO THE STARS AS WE NOW GO FROM LIVERPOOL TO NEW YORK EASILY
RAPIDLY SURELY AND THE ATMOSPHERIC OCEAN WILL BE AS SOON CROSSED AS
THE OCEANS OF THE EARTH DISTANCE IS ONLY A RELATIVE TERM AND WILL END
BY BEING REDUCED TO ZERO

THE ASSEMBLY THOUGH GREATLY IN FAVOUR OF THE FRENCH HERO WAS RATHER
STAGGERED BY THIS AUDACIOUS THEORY MICHEL ARDAN APPEARED TO SEE IT

YOU DO NOT SEEM CONVINCED MY WORTHY HOSTS HE CONTINUED WITH AN
AMIABLE SMILE WELL LET US REASON A LITTLE DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT
WOULD TAKE AN EXPRESS TRAIN TO REACH THE MOON THREE HUNDRED DAYS NOT
MORE A JOURNEY OF  LEAGUES BUT WHAT IS THAT NOT EVEN NINE TIMES
ROUND THE EARTH AND THERE ARE VERY FEW SAILORS WHO HAVE NOT DONE THAT
DURING THEIR EXISTENCE THINK I SHALL BE ONLY NINETYEIGHT HOURS ON THE
ROAD AH YOU IMAGINE THAT THE MOON IS A LONG WAY FROM THE EARTH AND
THAT ONE MUST THINK TWICE BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE ADVENTURE BUT WHAT
WOULD YOU SAY IF I WERE GOING TO NEPTUNE WHICH GRAVITATES AT
 LEAGUES FROM THE SUN THAT IS A JOURNEY THAT VERY FEW
PEOPLE COULD GO EVEN IF IT ONLY COST A FARTHING A MILE EVEN BARON
ROTHSCHILD WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE HIS TICKET

THIS ARGUMENT SEEMED GREATLY TO PLEASE THE ASSEMBLY BESIDES MICHEL
ARDAN FULL OF HIS SUBJECT GREW SUPERBLY ELOQUENT HE FELT HE WAS
LISTENED TO AND RESUMED WITH ADMIRABLE ASSURANCE

WELL MY FRIENDS THIS DISTANCE FROM NEPTUNE TO THE SUN IS NOTHING
COMPARED TO THAT OF THE STARS SOME OF WHICH ARE BILLIONS OF LEAGUES
FROM THE SUN AND YET PEOPLE SPEAK OF THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATES THE
PLANETS FROM THE SUN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK OF THIS UNIVERSE THAT
BEGINS WITH THE SUN AND ENDS AT NEPTUNE SHOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MY
THEORY IT IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE ACCORDING TO MY OPINION THE SOLAR
UNIVERSE IS ONE SOLID HOMOGENEOUS MASS THE PLANETS THAT COMPOSE IT ARE
CLOSE TOGETHER CROWD ONE ANOTHER AND THE SPACE BETWEEN THEM IS ONLY
THE SPACE THAT SEPARATES THE MOLECULES OF THE MOST COMPACT
METALSILVER IRON OR PLATINUM I HAVE THEREFORE THE RIGHT TO
AFFIRM AND I WILL REPEAT IT WITH A CONVICTION YOU WILL ALL
SHAREDISTANCE IS A VAIN WORD DISTANCE DOES NOT EXIST

WELL SAID BRAVO HURRAH CRIED THE ASSEMBLY WITH ONE VOICE
ELECTRIFIED BY THE GESTURE AND ACCENT OF THE ORATOR AND THE BOLDNESS OF
HIS CONCEPTIONS

NO CRIED JT MASTON MORE ENERGETICALLY THAN THE OTHERS DISTANCE
DOES NOT EXIST

AND CARRIED AWAY BY THE VIOLENCE OF HIS MOVEMENTS AND EMOTIONS HE COULD
HARDLY CONTAIN HE NEARLY FELL FROM THE TOP OF THE PLATFORM TO THE
GROUND BUT HE SUCCEEDED IN RECOVERING HIS EQUILIBRIUM AND THUS AVOIDED
A FALL THAT WOULD HAVE BRUTALLY PROVED DISTANCE NOT TO BE A VAIN WORD
THEN THE SPEECH OF THE DISTINGUISHED ORATOR RESUMED ITS COURSE

MY FRIENDS SAID HE I THINK THAT THIS QUESTION IS NOW SOLVED IF I
HAVE NOT CONVINCED YOU ALL IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TIMID IN MY
DEMONSTRATIONS FEEBLE IN MY ARGUMENTS AND YOU MUST SET IT DOWN TO MY
THEORETIC IGNORANCE HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I REPEAT THE DISTANCE FROM
THE EARTH TO HER SATELLITE IS REALLY VERY UNIMPORTANT AND UNWORTHY TO
OCCUPY A SERIOUS MIND I DO NOT THINK I AM ADVANCING TOO MUCH IN SAYING
THAT SOON A SERVICE OF TRAINS WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY PROJECTILES IN
WHICH THE JOURNEY FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON WILL BE COMFORTABLY
ACCOMPLISHED THERE WILL BE NO SHOCKS NOR RUNNING OFF THE LINES TO FEAR
AND THE GOAL WILL BE REACHED RAPIDLY WITHOUT FATIGUE IN A STRAIGHT
LINE AS THE CROW FLIES BEFORE TWENTY YEARS ARE OVER HALF THE EARTH
WILL HAVE VISITED THE MOON

THREE CHEERS FOR MICHEL ARDAN CRIED THE ASSISTANTS EVEN THOSE LEAST
CONVINCED

THREE CHEERS FOR BARBICANE MODESTLY ANSWERED THE ORATOR

THIS ACT OF GRATITUDE TOWARDS THE PROMOTER OF THE ENTERPRISE WAS GREETED
WITH UNANIMOUS APPLAUSE

NOW MY FRIENDS RESUMED MICHEL ARDAN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO
ASK ME YOU WILL EVIDENTLY EMBARRASS ME BUT STILL I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO
ANSWER YOU

UNTIL NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAD REASON TO BE VERY SATISFIED
WITH THE DISCUSSION IT HAD ROLLED UPON SPECULATIVE THEORIES UPON WHICH
MICHEL ARDAN CARRIED AWAY BY HIS LIVELY IMAGINATION HAD SHOWN HIMSELF
VERY BRILLIANT HE MUST THEREFORE BE PREVENTED FROM DEVIATING TOWARDS
PRACTICAL QUESTIONS WHICH HE WOULD DOUBTLESS NOT COME OUT OF SO WELL
BARBICANE MADE HASTE TO SPEAK AND ASKED HIS NEW FRIEND IF HE THOUGHT
THAT THE MOON OR THE PLANETS WERE INHABITED

THAT IS A GREAT PROBLEM MY WORTHY PRESIDENT ANSWERED THE ORATOR
SMILING STILL IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN MEN OF GREAT INTELLIGENCEPLUTARCH
SWEDENBORG BERNARDIN DE SAINTPIERRE AND MANY OTHERSANSWERED IN THE
AFFIRMATIVE IF I ANSWERED FROM A NATURAL PHILOSOPHY POINT OF VIEW I
SHOULD DO THE SAMEI SHOULD SAY TO MYSELF THAT NOTHING USELESS EXISTS
IN THIS WORLD AND ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION BY ANOTHER FRIEND
BARBICANE I SHOULD AFFIRM THAT IF THE PLANETS ARE INHABITABLE EITHER
THEY ARE INHABITED THEY HAVE BEEN OR THEY WILL BE

VERY WELL CRIED THE FIRST RANKS OF SPECTATORS WHOSE OPINION HAD THE
FORCE OF LAW FOR THE OTHERS

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER WITH MORE LOGIC AND JUSTICE SAID THE
PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB THE QUESTION THEREFORE COMES TO THIS ARE
THE PLANETS INHABITABLE I THINK SO FOR MY PART

AND II AM CERTAIN OF IT ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN

STILL REPLIED ONE OF THE ASSISTANTS THERE ARE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE
INHABITABILITY OF THE WORLDS IN MOST OF THEM IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE
PRINCIPLES OF LIFE MUST BE MODIFIED THUS ONLY TO SPEAK OF THE PLANETS
THE PEOPLE MUST BE BURNT UP IN SOME AND FROZEN IN OTHERS ACCORDING AS
THEY ARE A LONG OR SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE SUN

I REGRET ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN NOT TO KNOW MY HONOURABLE OPPONENT
PERSONALLY HIS OBJECTION HAS ITS VALUE BUT I THINK IT MAY BE COMBATED
WITH SOME SUCCESS LIKE ALL THOSE OF WHICH THE HABITABILITY OF WORLDS
HAS BEEN THE OBJECT IF I WERE A PHYSICIAN I SHOULD SAY THAT IF THERE
WERE LESS CALORIC PUT IN MOTION IN THE PLANETS NEAREST TO THE SUN AND
MORE ON THE CONTRARY IN THE DISTANT PLANETS THIS SIMPLE PHENOMENON
WOULD SUFFICE TO EQUALISE THE HEAT AND RENDER THE TEMPERATURE OF THESE
WORLDS BEARABLE TO BEINGS ORGANISED LIKE WE ARE IF I WERE A NATURALIST
I SHOULD TELL HIM AFTER MANY ILLUSTRIOUS SAVANTS THAT NATURE
FURNISHES US ON EARTH WITH EXAMPLES OF ANIMALS LIVING IN VERY DIFFERENT
CONDITIONS OF HABITABILITY THAT FISH BREATHE IN A MEDIUM MORTAL TO THE
OTHER ANIMALS THAT AMPHIBIANS HAVE A DOUBLE EXISTENCE DIFFICULT TO
EXPLAIN THAT CERTAIN INHABITANTS OF THE SEA LIVE IN THE GREATEST
DEPTHS AND SUPPORT THERE WITHOUT BEING CRUSHED PRESSURES OF FIFTY OR
SIXTY ATMOSPHERES THAT SOME AQUATIC INSECTS INSENSIBLE TO THE
TEMPERATURE ARE MET WITH AT THE SAME TIME IN SPRINGS OF BOILING WATER
AND IN THE FROZEN PLAINS OF THE POLAR OCEANIN SHORT THERE ARE IN
NATURE MANY MEANS OF ACTION OFTEN INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT NO LESS REAL
IF I WERE A CHEMIST I SHOULD SAY THAT AEROLITESBODIES EVIDENTLY FORMED
AWAY FROM OUR TERRESTRIAL GLOBEHAVE WHEN ANALYSED REVEALED
INDISPUTABLE TRACES OF CARBON A SUBSTANCE THAT OWES ITS ORIGIN SOLELY
TO ORGANISED BEINGS AND WHICH ACCORDING TO REICHENBACHS EXPERIMENTS
MUST NECESSARILY HAVE BEEN ANIMALISED LASTLY IF I WERE A THEOLOGIAN
I SHOULD SAY THAT DIVINE REDEMPTION ACCORDING TO ST PAUL SEEMS
APPLICABLE NOT ONLY TO THE EARTH BUT TO ALL THE CELESTIAL BODIES BUT I
AM NEITHER A THEOLOGIAN CHEMIST NATURALIST NOR NATURAL PHILOSOPHER
SO IN MY PERFECT IGNORANCE OF THE GREAT LAWS THAT RULE THE UNIVERSE I
CAN ONLY ANSWER I DO NOT KNOW IF THE HEAVENLY BODIES ARE INHABITED
AND AS I DO NOT KNOW I AM GOING TO SEE

DID THE ADVERSARY OF MICHEL ARDANS THEORIES HAZARD ANY FURTHER
ARGUMENTS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FOR THE FRANTIC CRIES OF THE CROWD
WOULD HAVE PREVENTED ANY OPINION FROM BEING PROMULGATED WHEN SILENCE
WAS AGAIN RESTORED EVEN IN THE MOST DISTANT GROUPS THE TRIUMPHANT
ORATOR CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ADDING THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS

YOU WILL THINK GENTLEMEN THAT I HAVE HARDLY TOUCHED UPON THIS GRAVE
QUESTION I AM NOT HERE TO GIVE YOU AN INSTRUCTIVE LECTURE UPON THIS
VAST SUBJECT THERE IS ANOTHER SERIES OF ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE
HEAVENLY BODIES BEING INHABITED I DO NOT LOOK UPON THAT ALLOW ME ONLY
TO INSIST UPON ONE POINT TO THE PEOPLE WHO MAINTAIN THAT THE PLANETS
ARE NOT INHABITED YOU MUST ANSWER YOU MAY BE RIGHT IF IT IS
DEMONSTRATED THAT THE EARTH IS THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS BUT IT IS
NOT SO NOTWITHSTANDING VOLTAIRE IT HAS ONLY ONE SATELLITE WHILST
JUPITER URANUS SATURN AND NEPTUNE HAVE SEVERAL AT THEIR SERVICE AN
ADVANTAGE THAT IS NOT TO BE DISDAINED BUT THAT WHICH NOW RENDERS THE
EARTH AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE OF ABODE IS THE INCLINATION OF ITS AXIS
UPON ITS ORBIT HENCE THE INEQUALITY OF DAY AND NIGHT HENCE THE
UNFORTUNATE DIVERSITY OF SEASONS UPON OUR MISERABLE SPHEROID IT IS
ALWAYS EITHER TOO WARM OR TOO COLD WE ARE FROZEN IN WINTER AND ROASTED
IN SUMMER IT IS THE PLANET OF COLDS RHEUMATISM AND CONSUMPTION
WHILST ON THE SURFACE OF JUPITER FOR INSTANCE WHERE THE AXIS HAS ONLY
A VERY SLIGHT INCLINATION THE INHABITANTS CAN ENJOY INVARIABLE
TEMPERATURE THERE IS THE PERPETUAL SPRING SUMMER AUTUMN AND WINTER
ZONE EACH JOVIAN MAY CHOOSE THE CLIMATE THAT SUITS HIM AND MAY
SHELTER HIMSELF ALL HIS LIFE FROM THE VARIATIONS OF THE TEMPERATURE YOU
WILL DOUBTLESS AGREE TO THIS SUPERIORITY OF JUPITER OVER OUR PLANET
WITHOUT SPEAKING OF ITS YEARS WHICH EACH LASTS TWELVE YEARS WHAT IS
MORE IT IS EVIDENT TO ME THAT UNDER THESE AUSPICES AND UNDER SUCH
MARVELLOUS CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE THE INHABITANTS OF THAT FORTUNATE
WORLD ARE SUPERIOR BEINGSTHAT SAVANTS ARE MORE LEARNED ARTISTS MORE
ARTISTIC THE WICKED LESS WICKED AND THE GOOD ARE BETTER ALAS WHAT IS
WANTING TO OUR SPHEROID TO REACH THIS PERFECTION IS VERY LITTLEAN
AXIS OF ROTATION LESS INCLINED ON THE PLANE OF ITS ORBIT

WELL CRIED AN IMPETUOUS VOICE LET US UNITE OUR EFFORTS INVENT
MACHINES AND RECTIFY THE EARTHS AXIS

THUNDERS OF APPLAUSE GREETED THIS PROPOSITION THE AUTHOR OF WHICH COULD
BE NO OTHER THAN JT MASTON IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FIERY SECRETARY
HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY HIS INSTINCTS AS ENGINEER TO VENTURE SUCH A
PROPOSITION BUT IT MUST BE SAID FOR IT IS THE TRUTH MANY ENCOURAGED
HIM WITH THEIR CRIES AND DOUBTLESS IF THEY HAD FOUND THE RESTINGPOINT
DEMANDED BY ARCHIMEDES THE AMERICANS WOULD HAVE CONSTRUCTED A LEVER
CAPABLE OF RAISING THE WORLD AND REDRESSING ITS AXIS BUT THIS POINT WAS
WANTING TO THESE BOLD MECHANICIANS

NEVERTHELESS THIS EMINENTLY PRACTICAL IDEA HAD ENORMOUS SUCCESS THE
DISCUSSION WAS SUSPENDED FOR A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND LONG VERY
LONG AFTERWARDS THEY TALKED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OF THE
PROPOSITION SO ENERGETICALLY ENUNCIATED BY THE PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF
THE GUN CLUB




CHAPTER XX

THRUST AND PARRY


THIS INCIDENT SEEMED TO HAVE TERMINATED THE DISCUSSION BUT WHEN THE
AGITATION HAD SUBSIDED THESE WORDS WERE HEARD UTTERED IN A LOUD AND
SEVERE VOICE

NOW THAT THE ORATOR HAS ALLOWED HIS FANCY TO ROAM PERHAPS HE WOULD
KINDLY GO BACK TO HIS SUBJECT PAY LESS ATTENTION TO THEORIES AND
DISCUSS THE PRACTICAL PART OF HIS EXPEDITION

ALL EYES WERE TURNED TOWARDS THE PERSON WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS A THIN
DRYLOOKING MAN WITH AN ENERGETIC FACE AND AN AMERICAN BEARD BY TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE AGITATION IN THE ASSEMBLY FROM TIME TO TIME HE HAD
GAINED BY DEGREES THE FRONT ROW OF SPECTATORS THERE WITH HIS ARMS
CROSSED HIS EYES BRILLIANT AND BOLD HE STARED IMPERTURBABLY AT THE
HERO OF THE MEETING AFTER HAVING ASKED HIS QUESTION HE KEPT SILENCE
AND DID NOT SEEM DISTURBED BY THE THOUSANDS OF EYES DIRECTED TOWARDS HIM
NOR BY THE DISAPPROVING MURMUR EXCITED BY HIS WORDS THE ANSWER BEING
DELAYED HE AGAIN PUT THE QUESTION WITH THE SAME CLEAR AND PRECISE
ACCENT THEN HE ADDED

WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS THE MOON NOT THE EARTH

YOU ARE RIGHT SIR ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN THE DISCUSSION HAS
WANDERED FROM THE POINT WE WILL RETURN TO THE MOON

SIR RESUMED THE UNKNOWN MAN YOU PRETEND THAT OUR SATELLITE IS
INHABITED SO FAR SO GOOD BUT IF SELENITES DO EXIST THEY CERTAINLY LIVE
WITHOUT BREATHING FORI TELL YOU THE FACT FOR YOUR GOODTHERE IS NOT
THE LEAST PARTICLE OF AIR ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON

AT THIS AFFIRMATION ARDAN SHOOK HIS RED MANE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT A
STRUGGLE WAS COMING WITH THIS MAN ON THE REAL QUESTION HE LOOKED AT HIM
FIXEDLY IN HIS TURN AND SAID

AH THERE IS NO AIR IN THE MOON AND WHO SAYS SO PRAY

THE SAVANTS

INDEED

INDEED

SIR RESUMED MICHEL JOKING APART I HAVE A PROFOUND RESPECT FOR
SAVANTS WHO KNOW BUT A PROFOUND CONTEMPT FOR SAVANTS WHO DO NOT
KNOW

DO YOU KNOW ANY WHO BELONG TO THE LATTER CATEGORY

YES IN FRANCE THERE IS ONE WHO MAINTAINS THAT MATHEMATICALLY A
BIRD CANNOT FLY AND ANOTHER WHO DEMONSTRATES THAT A FISH IS NOT MADE TO
LIVE IN WATER

THERE IS NO QUESTION OF THOSE TWO SIR AND I CAN QUOTE IN SUPPORT OF
MY PROPOSITION NAMES THAT YOU WILL NOT OBJECT TO

THEN SIR YOU WOULD GREATLY EMBARRASS A POOR IGNORANT MAN LIKE ME

THEN WHY DO YOU MEDDLE WITH SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER
STUDIED ASKED THE UNKNOWN BRUTALLY

WHY ANSWERED ARDAN BECAUSE THE MAN WHO DOES NOT SUSPECT DANGER IS
ALWAYS BRAVE I KNOW NOTHING IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS PRECISELY MY
WEAKNESS THAT MAKES MY STRENGTH

YOUR WEAKNESS GOES AS FAR AS MADNESS EXCLAIMED THE UNKNOWN IN A
BADTEMPERED TONE

SO MUCH THE BETTER REPLIED THE FRENCHMAN IF MY MADNESS TAKES ME TO
THE MOON

BARBICANE AND HIS COLLEAGUES STARED AT THE INTRUDER WHO HAD COME SO
BOLDLY TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THEIR ENTERPRISE NONE OF THEM KNEW HIM
AND THE PRESIDENT NOT REASSURED UPON THE UPSHOT OF SUCH A DISCUSSION
LOOKED AT HIS NEW FRIEND WITH SOME APPREHENSION THE ASSEMBLY WAS
ATTENTIVE AND SLIGHTLY UNEASY FOR THIS STRUGGLE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE
DANGERS AND IMPOSSIBILITIES OF THE EXPEDITION

SIR RESUMED MICHEL ARDANS ADVERSARY THE REASONS THAT PROVE THE
ABSENCE OF ALL ATMOSPHERE ROUND THE MOON ARE NUMEROUS AND INDISPUTABLE
I MAY SAY EVEN THAT A PRIORI IF THAT ATMOSPHERE HAD EVER EXISTED
IT MUST HAVE BEEN DRAWN AWAY BY THE EARTH BUT I WOULD RATHER OPPOSE YOU
WITH INCONTESTABLE FACTS

OPPOSE SIR ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN WITH PERFECT GALLANTRYOPPOSE AS
MUCH AS YOU LIKE

YOU KNOW SAID THE UNKNOWN THAT WHEN THE SUNS RAYS TRAVERSE A
MEDIUM LIKE AIR THEY ARE DEVIATED FROM A STRAIGHT LINE OR IN OTHER
WORDS THEY ARE REFRACTED WELL WHEN STARS ARE OCCULTED BY THE MOON
THEIR RAYS ON GRAZING THE EDGE OF HER DISC DO NOT SHOW THE LEAST
DEVIATION NOR OFFER THE SLIGHTEST INDICATION OF REFRACTION IT FOLLOWS
THEREFORE THAT THE MOON CAN HAVE NO ATMOSPHERE

EVERY ONE LOOKED AT THE FRENCHMAN FOR THIS ONCE ADMITTED THE
CONSEQUENCES WERE RIGOROUS

IN FACT ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN THAT IS YOUR BEST IF NOT ONLY
ARGUMENT AND A SAVANT PERHAPS WOULD BE EMBARRASSED TO ANSWER IT I
CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT THIS ARGUMENT HAS NO ABSOLUTE VALUE BECAUSE IT
SUPPOSES THE ANGULAR DIAMETER OF THE MOON TO BE PERFECTLY DETERMINED
WHICH IT IS NOT BUT LET US WAIVE THAT AND TELL ME MY DEAR SIR IF
YOU ADMIT THE EXISTENCE OF VOLCANOES ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON

EXTINCT VOLCANOES YES VOLCANOES IN ERUPTION NO

FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT LET US SUPPOSE THAT THESE VOLCANOES HAVE BEEN
IN ERUPTION FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD

THAT IS CERTAIN BUT AS THEY CAN THEMSELVES FURNISH THE OXYGEN
NECESSARY FOR COMBUSTION THE FACT OF THEIR ERUPTION DOES NOT IN THE
LEAST PROVE THE PRESENCE OF A LUNAR ATMOSPHERE

WE WILL PASS ON THEN ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN AND LEAVE THIS SERIES
OF ARGUMENT AND ARRIVE AT DIRECT OBSERVATION BUT I WARN YOU THAT I AM
GOING TO QUOTE NAMES

VERY WELL

IN  THE ASTRONOMERS LOUVILLE AND HALLEY OBSERVING THE ECLIPSE OF
THE RD OF MAY REMARKED CERTAIN FULMINATIONS OF A REMARKABLE NATURE
THESE JETS OF LIGHT RAPID AND FREQUENT WERE ATTRIBUTED BY THEM TO
STORMS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE MOON

IN  REPLIED THE UNKNOWN THE ASTRONOMERS LOUVILLE AND HALLEY
TOOK FOR LUNAR PHENOMENA PHENOMENA PURELY TERRESTRIAL SUCH AS METEORIC
OR OTHER BODIES WHICH ARE GENERATED IN OUR OWN ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS THE
SCIENTIFIC ASPECT OF THESE FACTS AND I GO WITH IT

LET US PASS ON AGAIN ANSWERED ARDAN WITHOUT BEING CONFUSED BY THE
REPLY DID NOT HERSCHEL IN  OBSERVE A GREAT NUMBER OF LUMINOUS
POINTS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON

CERTAINLY BUT WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE ORIGIN OF THESE LUMINOUS POINTS
HERSCHEL HIMSELF DID NOT THEREBY CONCLUDE THE NECESSITY OF A LUNAR
ATMOSPHERE

WELL ANSWERED SAID MICHEL ARDAN COMPLIMENTING HIS ADVERSARY I SEE
THAT YOU ARE WELL UP IN SELENOGRAPHY

YES SIR AND I MAY ADD THAT THE MOST SKILFUL OBSERVERS MM BOEER AND
MOEDLER AGREE THAT AIR IS ABSOLUTELY WANTING ON THE MOONS SURFACE

A MOVEMENT TOOK PLACE AMONGST THE AUDIENCE WHO APPEARED STRUCK BY THE
ARGUMENTS OF THIS SINGULAR PERSONAGE

WE WILL PASS ON AGAIN ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN WITH THE GREATEST
CALMNESS AND ARRIVE NOW AT AN IMPORTANT FACT A SKILFUL FRENCH
ASTRONOMER M LAUSSEDAT WHILST OBSERVING THE ECLIPSE OF JULY TH
 PROVED THAT THE HORNS OF THE SOLAR CRESCENT WERE ROUNDED AND
TRUNCATED NOW THIS APPEARANCE COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A
DEVIATION OF THE SOLAR RAYS IN TRAVERSING THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE MOON
THERE IS NO OTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE FACT

BUT IS THIS FACT AUTHENTICATED

IT IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

AN INVERSE MOVEMENT BROUGHT BACK THE AUDIENCE TO THE SIDE OF THEIR
FAVOURITE HERO WHOSE ADVERSARY REMAINED SILENT

ARDAN WENT ON SPEAKING WITHOUT SHOWING ANY VANITY ABOUT HIS LAST
ADVANTAGE HE SAID SIMPLY

YOU SEE THEREFORE MY DEAR SIR THAT IT CANNOT BE POSITIVELY AFFIRMED
THAT THERE IS NO ATMOSPHERE ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON THIS ATMOSPHERE
IS PROBABLY NOT DENSE BUT SCIENCE NOW GENERALLY ADMITS THAT IT EXISTS

NOT UPON THE MOUNTAINS REPLIED THE UNKNOWN WHO WOULD NOT GIVE IN

NO BUT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE VALLEYS AND IT IS NOT MORE THAN SOME
HUNDREDS OF FEET DEEP

ANY WAY YOU WILL DO WELL TO TAKE YOUR PRECAUTIONS FOR THE AIR WILL BE
TERRIBLY RAREFIED

OH THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ENOUGH FOR ONE MAN BESIDES ONCE DELIVERED UP
THERE I SHALL DO MY BEST TO ECONOMISE IT AND ONLY TO BREATHE IT ON
GREAT OCCASIONS

A FORMIDABLE BURST OF LAUGHTER SALUTED THE MYSTERIOUS INTERLOCUTOR WHO
LOOKED ROUND THE ASSEMBLY DARING IT PROUDLY

THEN RESUMED MICHEL ARDAN CARELESSLY AS WE ARE AGREED UPON THE
PRESENCE OF SOME ATMOSPHERE WE ARE FORCED TO ADMIT THE PRESENCE OF SOME
WATERA CONSEQUENCE I AM DELIGHTED WITH FOR MY PART BESIDES I HAVE
ANOTHER OBSERVATION TO MAKE WE ONLY KNOW ONE SIDE OF THE MOONS DISC
AND IF THERE IS LITTLE AIR ON THAT SIDE THERE MAY BE MUCH ON THE OTHER

HOW SO

BECAUSE THE MOON UNDER THE ACTION OF TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION HAS ASSUMED
THE FORM OF AN EGG OF WHICH WE SEE THE SMALL END HENCE THE CONSEQUENCE
DUE TO THE CALCULATIONS OF HAUSEN THAT ITS CENTRE OF GRAVITY IS
SITUATED IN THE OTHER HEMISPHERE HENCE THIS CONCLUSION THAT ALL THE
MASSES OF AIR AND WATER HAVE BEEN DRAWN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF OUR
SATELLITE IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THE CREATION

PURE FANCIES EXCLAIMED THE UNKNOWN

NO PURE THEORIES BASED UPON MECHANICAL LAWS AND IT APPEARS DIFFICULT
TO ME TO REFUTE THEM I MAKE APPEAL TO THIS ASSEMBLY AND PUT IT TO THE
VOTE TO KNOW IF LIFE SUCH AS IT EXISTS UPON EARTH IS POSSIBLE ON THE
SURFACE OF THE MOON

THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HEARERS APPLAUDED THIS PROPOSITION MICHEL
ARDANS ADVERSARY WISHED TO SPEAK AGAIN BUT HE COULD NOT MAKE HIMSELF
HEARD CRIES AND THREATS WERE HAILED UPON HIM

ENOUGH ENOUGH SAID SOME

TURN HIM OUT REPEATED OTHERS

BUT HE HOLDING ON TO THE PLATFORM DID NOT MOVE AND LET THE STORM
PASS BY IT MIGHT HAVE ASSUMED FORMIDABLE PROPORTIONS IF MICHEL ARDAN
HAD NOT APPEASED IT BY A GESTURE HE WAS TOO CHIVALROUS TO ABANDON HIS
CONTRADICTER IN SUCH AN EXTREMITY

YOU WISH TO ADD A FEW WORDS HE ASKED IN THE MOST GRACIOUS TONE

YES A HUNDRED A THOUSAND ANSWERED THE UNKNOWN CARRIED AWAY OR
RATHER NO ONE ONLY TO PERSEVERE IN YOUR ENTERPRISE YOU MUST BE

IMPRUDENT HOW CAN YOU CALL ME THAT WHEN I HAVE ASKED FOR A
CYLINDROCONICAL BULLET FROM MY FRIEND BARBICANE SO AS NOT TO TURN ROUND
ON THE ROAD LIKE A SQUIRREL

BUT UNFORTUNATE MAN THE FEARFUL SHOCK WILL SMASH YOU TO PIECES WHEN
YOU START

YOU HAVE THERE PUT YOUR FINGER UPON THE REAL AND ONLY DIFFICULTY BUT I
HAVE TOO GOOD AN OPINION OF THE INDUSTRIAL GENIUS OF THE AMERICANS TO
BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL NOT OVERCOME THAT DIFFICULTY

BUT THE HEAT DEVELOPED BY THE SPEED OF THE PROJECTILE WHILST CROSSING
THE BEDS OF AIR

OH ITS SIDES ARE THICK AND I SHALL SO SOON PASS THE ATMOSPHERE

BUT PROVISIONS WATER

I HAVE CALCULATED THAT I COULD CARRY ENOUGH FOR ONE YEAR AND I SHALL
ONLY BE FOUR DAYS GOING

BUT AIR TO BREATHE ON THE ROAD

I SHALL MAKE SOME BY CHEMICAL PROCESSES

BUT YOUR FALL UPON THE MOON SUPPOSING YOU EVER GET THERE

IT WILL BE SIX TIMES LESS RAPID THAN A FALL UPON THE EARTH AS
ATTRACTION IS SIX TIMES LESS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON

BUT IT STILL WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SMASH YOU LIKE GLASS

WHAT WILL PREVENT ME DELAYING MY FALL BY MEANS OF ROCKETS CONVENIENTLY
PLACED AND LIGHTED AT THE PROPER TIME

BUT LASTLY SUPPOSING THAT ALL DIFFICULTIES BE SOLVED ALL OBSTACLES
CLEARED AWAY BY UNITING EVERY CHANCE IN YOUR FAVOUR ADMITTING THAT YOU
REACH THE MOON SAFE AND WELL HOW SHALL YOU COME BACK

I SHALL NOT COME BACK

UPON THIS ANSWER WHICH WAS ALMOST SUBLIME BY REASON OF ITS SIMPLICITY
THE ASSEMBLY REMAINED SILENT BUT ITS SILENCE WAS MORE ELOQUENT THAN ITS
CRIES OF ENTHUSIASM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE UNKNOWN PROFITED BY IT TO
PROTEST ONE LAST TIME

YOU WILL INFALLIBLY KILL YOURSELF HE CRIED AND YOUR DEATH WHICH
WILL BE ONLY A MADMANS DEATH WILL NOT EVEN BE USEFUL TO SCIENCE

GO ON MOST GENEROUS OF MEN FOR YOU PROPHESY IN THE MOST AGREEABLE
MANNER

AH IT IS TOO MUCH EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDANS ADVERSARY AND I DO NOT
KNOW WHY I GO ON WITH SO CHILDISH A DISCUSSION GO ON WITH YOUR MAD
ENTERPRISE AS YOU LIKE IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT

FIRE AWAY

NO ANOTHER MUST BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUR ACTS

WHO IS THAT PRAY ASKED MICHEL ARDAN IN AN IMPERIOUS VOICE

THE FOOL WHO HAS ORGANISED THIS ATTEMPT AS IMPOSSIBLE AS IT IS
RIDICULOUS

THE ATTACK WAS DIRECT BARBICANE SINCE THE INTERVENTION OF THE UNKNOWN
HAD MADE VIOLENT EFFORTS TO CONTAIN HIMSELF AND CONSUME HIS OWN SMOKE
BUT UPON SEEING HIMSELF SO OUTRAGEOUSLY DESIGNATED HE ROSE DIRECTLY AND
WAS GOING TO WALK TOWARDS HIS ADVERSARY WHO DARED HIM TO HIS FACE WHEN
HE FELT HIMSELF SUDDENLY SEPARATED FROM HIM

THE PLATFORM WAS LIFTED UP ALL AT ONCE BY A HUNDRED VIGOROUS ARMS AND
THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB WAS FORCED TO SHARE THE HONOURS OF TRIUMPH
WITH MICHEL ARDAN THE PLATFORM WAS HEAVY BUT THE BEARERS CAME IN
CONTINUOUS RELAYS DISPUTING STRUGGLING EVEN FIGHTING FOR THE
PRIVILEGE OF LENDING THE SUPPORT OF THEIR SHOULDERS TO THIS
MANIFESTATION

HOWEVER THE UNKNOWN DID NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TUMULT TO LEAVE THE
PLACE HE KEPT IN THE FRONT ROW HIS ARMS FOLDED STILL STARING AT
PRESIDENT BARBICANE

THE PRESIDENT DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HIM EITHER AND THE EYES OF THESE
TWO MEN MET LIKE FLAMING SWORDS

THE CRIES OF THE IMMENSE CROWDS KEPT AT THEIR MAXIMUM OF INTENSITY
DURING THIS TRIUMPHANT MARCH MICHEL ARDAN ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE CARRIED
WITH EVIDENT PLEASURE

SOMETIMES THE PLATFORM PITCHED AND TOSSED LIKE A SHIP BEATEN BY THE
WAVES BUT THE TWO HEROES OF THE MEETING WERE GOOD SAILORS AND THEIR
VESSEL SAFELY ARRIVED IN THE PORT OF TAMPA TOWN

MICHEL ARDAN HAPPILY SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING FROM HIS VIGOROUS ADMIRERS
HE FLED TO THE FRANKLIN HOTEL QUICKLY REACHED HIS ROOM AND GLIDED
RAPIDLY INTO BED WHILST AN ARMY OF  MEN WATCHED UNDER HIS
WINDOWS

IN THE MEANWHILE A SHORT GRAVE AND DECISIVE SCENE HAD TAKEN PLACE
BETWEEN THE MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB

BARBICANE LIBERATED AT LAST WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS ADVERSARY

COME SAID HE IN A CURT VOICE

THE STRANGER FOLLOWED HIM ON TO THE QUAY AND THEY WERE SOON BOTH ALONE
AT THE ENTRANCE TO A WHARF OPENING ON TO JONES FALL

THERE THESE ENEMIES STILL UNKNOWN TO ONE ANOTHER LOOKED AT EACH OTHER

WHO ARE YOU ASKED BARBICANE

CAPTAIN NICHOLL

I THOUGHT SO UNTIL NOW FATE HAS NEVER MADE YOU CROSS MY PATH

I CROSSED IT OF MY OWN ACCORD

YOU HAVE INSULTED ME

PUBLICLY

AND YOU SHALL GIVE ME SATISFACTION FOR THAT INSULT

NOW THIS MINUTE

NO I WISH EVERYTHING BETWEEN US TO BE KEPT SECRET THERE IS A WOOD
SITUATED THREE MILES FROM TAMPASKERSNAW WOOD DO YOU KNOW IT

YES

WILL YOU ENTER IT TOMORROW MORNING AT FIVE OCLOCK BY ONE SIDE

YES IF YOU WILL ENTER IT BY THE OTHER AT THE SAME TIME

AND YOU WILL NOT FORGET YOUR RIFLE SAID BARBICANE

NOT MORE THAN YOU WILL FORGET YOURS ANSWERED CAPTAIN NICHOLL

AFTER THESE WORDS HAD BEEN COLDLY PRONOUNCED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN
CLUB AND THE CAPTAIN SEPARATED BARBICANE RETURNED TO HIS DWELLING BUT
INSTEAD OF TAKING SOME HOURS REST HE PASSED THE NIGHT IN SEEKING MEANS
TO AVOID THE SHOCK OF THE PROJECTILE AND TO SOLVE THE DIFFICULT PROBLEM
GIVEN BY MICHEL ARDAN AT THE MEETING




CHAPTER XXI

HOW A FRENCHMAN SETTLES AN AFFAIR


WHILST THE DUEL WAS BEING DISCUSSED BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE
CAPTAINA TERRIBLE AND SAVAGE DUEL IN WHICH EACH ADVERSARY BECAME A
MANHUNTERMICHEL ARDAN WAS RESTING AFTER THE FATIGUES OF HIS TRIUMPH
RESTING IS EVIDENTLY NOT THE RIGHT EXPRESSION FOR AMERICAN BEDS RIVAL
IN HARDNESS TABLES OF MARBLE OR GRANITE

ARDAN SLEPT BADLY TURNING OVER AND OVER BETWEEN THE SERVIETTES THAT
SERVED HIM FOR SHEETS AND HE WAS THINKING OF INSTALLING A MORE
COMFORTABLE BED IN HIS PROJECTILE WHEN A VIOLENT NOISE STARTLED HIM FROM
HIS SLUMBERS THUNDERING BLOWS SHOOK HIS DOOR THEY SEEMED TO BE
ADMINISTERED WITH AN IRON INSTRUMENT SHOUTS WERE HEARD IN THIS RACKET
RATHER TOO EARLY TO BE AGREEABLE

OPEN SOME ONE CRIED OPEN FOR HEAVENS SAKE

THERE WAS NO REASON WHY ARDAN SHOULD ACQUIESCE IN SO PEREMPTORY A
DEMAND STILL HE ROSE AND OPENED HIS DOOR AT THE MOMENT IT WAS GIVING
WAY UNDER THE EFFORTS OF THE OBSTINATE VISITOR

THE SECRETARY OF THE GUN CLUB BOUNDED INTO THE ROOM A BOMB WOULD NOT
HAVE ENTERED WITH LESS CEREMONY

YESTERDAY EVENING EXCLAIMED JT MASTON EX ABRUPTO OUR PRESIDENT
WAS PUBLICLY INSULTED DURING THE MEETING HE HAS CHALLENGED HIS
ADVERSARY WHO IS NO OTHER THAN CAPTAIN NICHOLL THEY ARE GOING TO FIGHT
THIS MORNING IN SKERSNAW WOOD I LEARNT IT ALL FROM BARBICANE HIMSELF
IF HE IS KILLED OUR PROJECT WILL BE AT AN END THIS DUEL MUST BE
PREVENTED NOW ONE MAN ONLY CAN HAVE ENOUGH EMPIRE OVER BARBICANE TO
STOP IT AND THAT MAN IS MICHEL ARDAN

WHILST JT MASTON WAS SPEAKING THUS MICHEL ARDAN GIVING UP
INTERRUPTING HIM JUMPED INTO HIS VAST TROUSERS AND IN LESS THAN TWO
MINUTES AFTER THE TWO FRIENDS WERE RUSHING AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO
TOWARDS THE SUBURBS OF TAMPA TOWN

IT WAS DURING THIS RAPID COURSE THAT MASTON TOLD ARDAN THE STATE OF THE
CASE HE TOLD HIM THE REAL CAUSES OF THE ENMITY BETWEEN BARBICANE AND
NICHOLL HOW THAT ENMITY WAS OF OLD DATE WHY UNTIL THEN THANKS TO
MUTUAL FRIENDS THE PRESIDENT AND THE CAPTAIN HAD NEVER MET HE ADDED
THAT IT WAS SOLELY A RIVALRY BETWEEN IRONPLATE AND BULLET AND LASTLY
THAT THE SCENE OF THE MEETING HAD ONLY BEEN AN OCCASION LONG SOUGHT BY
NICHOLL TO SATISFY AN OLD GRUDGE

THERE IS NOTHING MORE TERRIBLE THAN THESE PRIVATE DUELS IN AMERICA
DURING WHICH THE TWO ADVERSARIES SEEK EACH OTHER ACROSS THICKETS AND
HUNT EACH OTHER LIKE WILD ANIMALS IT IS THEN THAT EACH MUST ENVY THOSE
MARVELLOUS QUALITIES SO NATURAL TO THE INDIANS OF THE PRAIRIES THEIR
RAPID INTELLIGENCE THEIR INGENIOUS RUSE THEIR SCENT OF THE ENEMY AN
ERROR A HESITATION A WRONG STEP MAY CAUSE DEATH IN THESE MEETINGS
THE YANKEES ARE OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR DOGS AND BOTH SPORTSMEN AND
GAME GO ON FOR HOURS

WHAT DEMONS YOU ARE EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN WHEN HIS COMPANION HAD
DEPICTED THE SCENE WITH MUCH ENERGY

WE ARE WHAT WE ARE ANSWERED JT MASTON MODESTLY BUT LET US MAKE
HASTE

IN VAIN DID MICHEL ARDAN AND HE RUSH ACROSS THE PLAIN STILL WET WITH
DEW JUMP THE CREEKS TAKE THE SHORTEST CUTS THEY COULD NOT REACH
SKERSNAW WOOD BEFORE HALFPAST FIVE BARBICANE MUST HAVE ENTERED IT
HALFANHOUR BEFORE

THERE AN OLD BUSHMAN WAS TYING UP FAGGOTS HIS AXE HAD CUT

MASTON RAN TO HIM CRYING

HAVE YOU SEEN A MAN ENTER THE WOOD ARMED WITH A RIFLE BARBICANE THE
PRESIDENTMY BEST FRIEND

THE WORTHY SECRETARY OF THE GUN CLUB THOUGHT NAIVELY THAT ALL THE WORLD
MUST KNOW HIS PRESIDENT BUT THE BUSHMAN DID NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND

A SPORTSMAN THEN SAID ARDAN

A SPORTSMAN YES ANSWERED THE BUSHMAN

IS IT LONG SINCE

ABOUT AN HOUR AGO

TOO LATE EXCLAIMED MASTON

HAVE YOU HEARD ANY FIRING ASKED MICHEL ARDAN

NO

NOT ONE SHOT

NOT ONE THAT SPORTSMAN DOES NOT SEEM TO BAG MUCH GAME

WHAT SHALL WE DO SAID MASTON

ENTER THE WOOD AT THE RISK OF CATCHING A BULLET NOT MEANT FOR US

AH EXCLAIMED MASTON WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE ACCENT I WOULD RATHER
HAVE TEN BULLETS IN MY HEAD THAN ONE IN BARBICANES HEAD

GO AHEAD THEN SAID ARDAN PRESSING HIS COMPANIONS HAND

A FEW SECONDS AFTER THE TWO COMPANIONS DISAPPEARED IN A COPSE IT WAS A
DENSE THICKET MADE OF HUGE CYPRESSES SYCAMORES TULIPTREES OLIVES
TAMARINDS OAKS AND MAGNOLIAS THE DIFFERENT TREES INTERMINGLED THEIR
BRANCHES IN INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION AND QUITE HID THE VIEW MICHEL ARDAN
AND MASTON WALKED ON SIDE BY SIDE PHASING SILENTLY THROUGH THE TALL
GRASS MAKING A ROAD FOR THEMSELVES THROUGH THE VIGOROUS CREEPERS
LOOKING IN ALL THE BUSHES OR BRANCHES LOST IN THE SOMBRE SHADE OF THE
FOLIAGE AND EXPECTING TO HEAR A SHOT AT EVERY STEP AS TO THE TRACES
THAT BARBICANE MUST HAVE LEFT OF HIS PASSAGE THROUGH THE WOOD IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SEE THEM AND THEY MARCHED BLINDLY ON IN THE
HARDLYFORMED PATHS IN WHICH AN INDIAN WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED HIS ADVERSARY
STEP BY STEP

AFTER A VAIN SEARCH OF ABOUT AN HOURS LENGTH THE TWO COMPANIONS
STOPPED THEIR ANXIETY WAS REDOUBLED

IT MUST BE ALL OVER SAID MASTON IN DESPAIR A MAN LIKE BARBICANE
WOULD NOT LAY TRAPS OR CONDESCEND TO ANY MANOEUVRE HE IS TOO FRANK TOO
COURAGEOUS HE HAS GONE STRAIGHT INTO DANGER AND DOUBTLESS FAR ENOUGH
FROM THE BUSHMAN FOR THE WIND TO CARRY OFF THE NOISE OF THE SHOT

BUT WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD IT ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN

BUT WHAT IF WE CAME TOO LATE EXCLAIMED JT MASTON IN AN ACCENT OF
DESPAIR

MICHEL ARDAN DID NOT FIND ANY ANSWER TO MAKE MASTON AND HE RESUMED
THEIR INTERRUPTED WALK FROM TIME TO TIME THEY SHOUTED THEY CALLED
EITHER BARBICANE OR NICHOLL BUT NEITHER OF THE TWO ADVERSARIES
ANSWERED JOYFUL FLOCKS OF BIRDS ROUSED BY THE NOISE DISAPPEARED
AMONGST THE BRANCHES AND SOME FRIGHTENED DEER FLED THROUGH THE COPSES

THEY CONTINUED THEIR SEARCH ANOTHER HOUR THE GREATER PART OF THE WOOD
HAD BEEN EXPLORED NOTHING REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF THE COMBATANTS THEY
BEGAN TO DOUBT THE AFFIRMATION OF THE BUSHMAN AND ARDAN WAS GOING TO
RENOUNCE THE PURSUIT AS USELESS WHEN ALL AT ONCE MASTON STOPPED

HUSH SAID HE THERE IS SOME ONE YONDER

SOME ONE ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN

YES A MAN HE DOES NOT SEEM TO MOVE HIS RIFLE IS NOT IN HIS HAND
WHAT CAN HE BE DOING

BUT DO YOU RECOGNISE HIM ASKED MICHEL ARDAN

YES YES HE IS TURNING ROUND ANSWERED MASTON

WHO IS IT

CAPTAIN NICHOLL

NICHOLL CRIED MICHEL ARDAN WHOSE HEART ALMOST STOPPED BEATING

NICHOLL DISARMED THEN HE HAD NOTHING MORE TO FEAR FROM HIS ADVERSARY

LET US GO TO HIM SAID MICHEL ARDAN WE SHALL KNOW HOW IT IS

BUT HIS COMPANION AND HE HAD NOT GONE FIFTY STEPS WHEN THEY STOPPED TO
EXAMINE THE CAPTAIN MORE ATTENTIVELY THEY IMAGINED THEY SHOULD FIND A
BLOODTHIRSTY AND REVENGEFUL MAN UPON SEEING HIM THEY REMAINED
STUPEFIED

A NET WITH FINE MESHES WAS HUNG BETWEEN TWO GIGANTIC TULIPTREES AND IN
IT A SMALL BIRD WITH ITS WINGS ENTANGLED WAS STRUGGLING WITH PLAINTIVE
CRIES THE BIRDCATCHER WHO HAD HUNG THE NET WAS NOT A HUMAN BEING BUT A
VENOMOUS SPIDER PECULIAR TO THE COUNTRY AS LARGE AS A PIGEONS EGG
AND FURNISHED WITH ENORMOUS LEGS THE HIDEOUS INSECT AS HE WAS RUSHING
ON HIS PREY WAS FORCED TO TURN BACK AND TAKE REFUGE IN THE HIGH
BRANCHES OF A TULIPTREE FOR A FORMIDABLE ENEMY THREATENED HIM IN HIS
TURN

IN FACT CAPTAIN NICHOLL WITH HIS GUN ON THE GROUND FORGETTING THE
DANGERS OF HIS SITUATION WAS OCCUPIED IN DELIVERING AS DELICATELY AS
POSSIBLE THE VICTIM TAKEN IN THE MESHES OF THE MONSTROUS SPIDER WHEN HE
HAD FINISHED HE LET THE LITTLE BIRD FLY AWAY IT FLUTTERED ITS WINGS
JOYFULLY AND DISAPPEARED

NICHOLL TOUCHED WAS WATCHING IT FLY THROUGH THE COPSE WHEN HE HEARD
THESE WORDS UTTERED IN A VOICE FULL OF EMOTION

YOU ARE A BRAVE MAN YOU ARE

HE TURNED MICHEL ARDAN WAS IN FRONT OF HIM REPEATING IN EVERY TONE

AND A KIND ONE

MICHEL ARDAN EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN WHAT HAVE YOU COME HERE FOR
SIR

TO SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU NICHOLL AND PREVENT YOU KILLING BARBICANE OR
BEING KILLED BY HIM

BARBICANE CRIED THE CAPTAIN I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM THESE TWO
HOURS WITHOUT FINDING HIM WHERE IS HE HIDING HIMSELF

NICHOLL SAID MICHEL ARDAN THIS IS NOT POLITE YOU MUST ALWAYS
RESPECT YOUR ADVERSARY DONT BE UNEASY IF BARBICANE IS ALIVE WE SHALL
FIND HIM AND SO MUCH THE MORE EASILY THAT IF HE HAS NOT AMUSED HIMSELF
WITH PROTECTING BIRDS HE MUST BE LOOKING FOR YOU TOO BUT WHEN YOU HAVE
FOUND HIMAND MICHEL ARDAN TELLS YOU THISTHERE WILL BE NO DUEL
BETWEEN YOU

BETWEEN PRESIDENT BARBICANE AND ME ANSWERED NICHOLL GRAVELY THERE
IS SUCH RIVALRY THAT THE DEATH OF ONE OF US

COME COME RESUMED MICHEL ARDAN BRAVE MEN LIKE YOU MAY DETEST ONE
ANOTHER BUT THEY RESPECT ONE ANOTHER TOO YOU WILL NOT FIGHT

I SHALL FIGHT SIR

NO YOU WONT

CAPTAIN THEN SAID JT MASTON HEARTILY I AM THE PRESIDENTS FRIEND
HIS ALTER EGO IF YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY KILL SOME ONE KILL ME THAT WILL
BE EXACTLY THE SAME THING

SIR SAID NICHOLL CONVULSIVELY SEIZING HIS RIFLE THIS JOKING

FRIEND MASTON IS NOT JOKING ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN AND I UNDERSTAND
HIS WANTING TO BE KILLED FOR THE MAN HE LOVES BUT NEITHER HE NOR
BARBICANE WILL FALL UNDER CAPTAIN NICHOLLS BULLETS FOR I HAVE SO
TEMPTING A PROPOSITION TO MAKE TO THE TWO RIVALS THAT THEY WILL HASTEN
TO ACCEPT IT

BUT WHAT IS IT PRAY ASKED NICHOLL WITH VISIBLE INCREDULITY

PATIENCE ANSWERED ARDAN I CAN ONLY COMMUNICATE IT IN BARBICANES
PRESENCE

LET US LOOK FOR HIM THEN CRIED THE CAPTAIN

THE THREE MEN IMMEDIATELY SET OUT THE CAPTAIN HAVING DISCHARGED HIS
RIFLE THREW IT ON HIS SHOULDER AND WALKED ON IN SILENCE

DURING ANOTHER HALFHOUR THE SEARCH WAS IN VAIN MASTON WAS SEIZED WITH
A SINISTER PRESENTIMENT HE OBSERVED CAPTAIN NICHOLL CLOSELY ASKING
HIMSELF IF ONCE THE CAPTAINS VENGEANCE SATISFIED THE UNFORTUNATE
BARBICANE HAD NOT BEEN LEFT LYING IN SOME BLOODY THICKET MICHEL ARDAN
SEEMED TO HAVE THE SAME THOUGHT AND THEY WERE BOTH LOOKING
QUESTIONINGLY AT CAPTAIN NICHOLL WHEN MASTON SUDDENLY STOPPED

THE MOTIONLESS BUST OF A MAN LEANING AGAINST A GIGANTIC CATALPA APPEARED
TWENTY FEET OFF HALF HIDDEN IN THE GRASS

IT IS HE SAID MASTON

BARBICANE DID NOT MOVE ARDAN STARED AT THE CAPTAIN BUT HE DID NOT
WINCE ARDAN RUSHED FORWARD CRYING

BARBICANE BARBICANE

NO ANSWER ARDAN WAS ABOUT TO SEIZE HIS ARM HE STOPPED SHORT UTTERING
A CRY OF SURPRISE

BARBICANE WITH A PENCIL IN HIS HAND WAS TRACING GEOMETRICAL FIGURES
UPON A MEMORANDUMBOOK WHILST HIS UNLOADED GUN LAY ON THE GROUND

ABSORBED IN HIS WORK THE SAVANT FORGETTING IN HIS TURN HIS DUEL AND
HIS VENGEANCE HAD NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD ANYTHING

BUT WHEN MICHEL ARDAN PLACED HIS HAND ON THAT OF THE PRESIDENT HE GOT
UP AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT

AH CRIED HE AT LAST YOU HERE I HAVE FOUND IT MY FRIEND I HAVE
FOUND IT

WHAT

THE WAY TO DO IT

THE WAY TO DO WHAT

TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECT OF THE SHOCK AT THE DEPARTURE OF THE
PROJECTILE

REALLY SAID MICHEL LOOKING AT THE CAPTAIN OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS
EYE

YES WATER SIMPLY WATER WHICH WILL ACT AS A SPRING AH MASTON
CRIED BARBICANE YOU TOO

HIMSELF ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN AND ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE AT THE SAME
TIME THE WORTHY CAPTAIN NICHOLL

NICHOLL CRIED BARBICANE UP IN A MOMENT EXCUSE ME CAPTAIN SAID
HE I HAD FORGOTTEN I AM READY

MICHEL ARDAN INTERFERED BEFORE THE TWO ENEMIES HAD TIME TO RECRIMINATE

FAITH SAID HE IT IS FORTUNATE THAT BRAVE FELLOWS LIKE YOU DID NOT
MEET SOONER WE SHOULD NOW HAVE TO MOURN FOR ONE OR OTHER OF YOU BUT
THANKS TO GOD WHO HAS PREVENTED IT THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO FEAR WHEN
ONE FORGETS HIS HATRED TO PLUNGE INTO MECHANICAL PROBLEMS AND THE OTHER
TO PLAY TRICKS ON SPIDERS THEIR HATRED CANNOT BE DANGEROUS TO ANYBODY

AND MICHEL ARDAN RELATED THE CAPTAINS STORY TO THE PRESIDENT

I ASK YOU NOW SAID HE AS HE CONCLUDED IF TWO GOOD BEINGS LIKE YOU
WERE MADE TO BREAK EACH OTHERS HEADS WITH GUNSHOTS

THERE WAS IN THIS RATHER RIDICULOUS SITUATION SOMETHING SO UNEXPECTED
THAT BARBICANE AND NICHOLL DID NOT KNOW HOW TO LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER
MICHEL ARDAN FELT THIS AND RESOLVED TO TRY FOR A RECONCILIATION

MY BRAVE FRIENDS SAID HE SMILING IN HIS MOST FASCINATING MANNER IT
HAS ALL BEEN A MISTAKE BETWEEN YOU NOTHING MORE WELL TO PROVE THAT
ALL IS ENDED BETWEEN YOU AND AS YOU ARE MEN WHO RISK YOUR LIVES
FRANKLY ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION THAT I AM GOING TO MAKE TO YOU

SPEAK SAID NICHOLL

FRIEND BARBICANE BELIEVES THAT HIS PROJECTILE WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE
MOON

YES CERTAINLY REPLIED THE PRESIDENT

AND FRIEND NICHOLL IS PERSUADED THAT IT WILL FALL BACK ON THE EARTH

I AM CERTAIN OF IT CRIED THE CAPTAIN

GOOD RESUMED MICHEL ARDAN I DO NOT PRETEND TO MAKE YOU AGREE ALL I
SAY TO YOU IS COME WITH ME AND SEE IF WE SHALL STOP ON THE ROAD

WHAT SAID JT MASTON STUPEFIED

THE TWO RIVALS AT THIS SUDDEN PROPOSITION HAD RAISED THEIR EYES AND
LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ATTENTIVELY BARBICANE WAITED FOR CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
ANSWER NICHOLL AWAITED THE PRESIDENTS REPLY

WELL SAID MICHEL IN HIS MOST ENGAGING TONE AS THERE IS NOW NO SHOCK
TO FEAR

ACCEPTED CRIED BARBICANE

BUT ALTHOUGH THIS WORD WAS UTTERED VERY QUICKLY NICHOLL HAD FINISHED IT
AT THE SAME TIME

HURRAH BRAVO CRIED MICHEL ARDAN HOLDING OUT HIS HANDS TO THE TWO
ADVERSARIES AND NOW THAT THE AFFAIR IS ARRANGED MY FRIENDS ALLOW ME
TO TREAT YOU FRENCH FASHION ALLONS DEJEUNER




CHAPTER XXII

THE NEW CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES


THAT DAY ALL AMERICA HEARD ABOUT THE DUEL AND ITS SINGULAR TERMINATION
THE PART PLAYED BY THE CHIVALROUS EUROPEAN HIS UNEXPECTED PROPOSITION
WHICH SOLVED THE DIFFICULTY THE SIMULTANEOUS ACCEPTATION OF THE TWO
RIVALS THAT CONQUEST OF THE LUNAR CONTINENT TO WHICH FRANCE AND THE
UNITED STATES WERE GOING TO MARCH IN CONCERTEVERYTHING TENDED TO
INCREASE MICHEL ARDANS POPULARITY IT IS WELL KNOWN HOW ENTHUSIASTIC
THE YANKEES WILL GET ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL IN A COUNTRY WHERE GRAVE
MAGISTRATES HARNESS THEMSELVES TO A DANCERS CARRIAGE AND DRAW IT IN
TRIUMPH IT MAY BE JUDGED HOW THE BOLD FRENCHMAN WAS TREATED IF THEY
DID NOT TAKE OUT HIS HORSES IT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE HE HAD NONE BUT ALL
OTHER MARKS OF ENTHUSIASM WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM THERE WAS NO CITIZEN
WHO DID NOT JOIN HIM HEART AND MINDEX PLURIBUS UNAM ACCORDING TO
THE MOTTO OF THE UNITED STATES

FROM THAT DAY MICHEL ARDAN HAD NOT A MINUTES REST DEPUTATIONS FROM ALL
PARTS OF THE UNION WORRIED HIM INCESSANTLY HE WAS FORCED TO RECEIVE
THEM WHETHER HE WOULD OR NO THE HANDS HE SHOOK COULD NOT BE COUNTED HE
WAS SOON COMPLETELY WORN OUT HIS VOICE BECAME HOARSE IN CONSEQUENCE OF
HIS INNUMERABLE SPEECHES AND ONLY ESCAPED FROM HIS LIPS IN
UNINTELLIGIBLE SOUNDS AND HE NEARLY CAUGHT A GASTROENTERITE AFTER THE
TOASTS HE PROPOSED TO THE UNION THIS SUCCESS WOULD HAVE INTOXICATED
ANOTHER MAN FROM THE FIRST BUT HE MANAGED TO STAY IN A SPIRITUELLE
AND CHARMING DEMIINEBRIETY

AMONGST THE DEPUTATIONS OF EVERY SORT THAT ASSAILED HIM THAT OF THE
LUNATICS DID NOT FORGET WHAT THEY OWED TO THE FUTURE CONQUEROR OF THE
MOON ONE DAY SOME OF THESE POOR CREATURES NUMEROUS ENOUGH IN AMERICA
WENT TO HIM AND ASKED TO RETURN WITH HIM TO THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY SOME
OF THEM PRETENDED TO SPEAK SELENITE AND WISHED TO TEACH IT TO MICHEL
ARDAN WHO WILLINGLY LENT HIMSELF TO THEIR INNOCENT MANIA AND PROMISED
TO TAKE THEIR MESSAGES TO THEIR FRIENDS IN THE MOON

SINGULAR FOLLY SAID HE TO BARBICANE AFTER HAVING DISMISSED THEM
AND A FOLLY THAT OFTEN TAKES POSSESSION OF MEN OF GREAT INTELLIGENCE
ONE OF OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SAVANTS ARAGO TOLD ME THAT MANY VERY
WISE AND RESERVED PEOPLE IN THEIR CONCEPTIONS BECAME MUCH EXCITED AND
GAVE WAY TO INCREDIBLE SINGULARITIES EVERY TIME THE MOON OCCUPIED THEM
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON UPON MALADIES

VERY LITTLE ANSWERED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB

I DO NOT EITHER AND YET HISTORY HAS PRESERVED SOME FACTS THAT TO SAY
THE LEAST ARE ASTONISHING THUS IN  DURING AN EPIDEMIC PEOPLE
PERISHED IN THE GREATEST NUMBERS ON THE ST OF JANUARY DURING AN
ECLIPSE THE CELEBRATED BACON FAINTED DURING THE MOON ECLIPSES AND ONLY
CAME TO HIMSELF AFTER ITS ENTIRE EMERSION KING CHARLES VI RELAPSED SIX
TIMES INTO MADNESS DURING THE YEAR  EITHER AT THE NEW OR FULL MOON
PHYSICIANS HAVE RANKED EPILEPSY AMONGST THE MALADIES THAT FOLLOW THE
PHASES OF THE MOON NERVOUS MALADIES HAVE OFTEN APPEARED TO BE
INFLUENCED BY IT MEAD SPEAKS OF A CHILD WHO HAD CONVULSIONS WHEN THE
MOON WAS IN OPPOSITION GALL REMARKED THAT INSANE PERSONS UNDERWENT AN
ACCESSION OF THEIR DISORDER TWICE IN EVERY MONTH AT THE EPOCHS OF THE
NEW AND FULL MOON LASTLY A THOUSAND OBSERVATIONS OF THIS SORT MADE
UPON MALIGNANT FEVERS AND SOMNAMBULISM TEND TO PROVE THAT THE QUEEN OF
NIGHT HAS A MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE UPON TERRESTRIAL MALADIES

BUT HOW WHY ASKED BARBICANE

WHY ANSWERED ARDAN WHY THE ONLY THING I CAN TELL YOU IS WHAT ARAGO
REPEATED NINETEEN CENTURIES AFTER PLUTARCH PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE IT IS
NOT TRUE

IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS TRIUMPH MICHEL ARDAN COULD NOT ESCAPE ANY OF THE
ANNOYANCES INCIDENTAL TO A CELEBRATED MAN MANAGERS OF ENTERTAINMENTS
WISHED TO EXHIBIT HIM BARNUM OFFERED HIM A MILLION DOLLARS TO SHOW HIM
AS A CURIOUS ANIMAL IN THE DIFFERENT TOWNS OF THE UNITED STATES

STILL THOUGH HE REFUSED TO SATISFY PUBLIC CURIOSITY IN THAT WAY HIS
PORTRAITS WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD AND OCCUPIED THE PLACE OF HONOUR IN
ALBUMS PROOFS WERE MADE OF ALL SIZES FROM LIFE SIZE TO MEDALLIONS
EVERY ONE COULD POSSESS THE HERO IN ALL POSITIONSHEAD BUST STANDING
FULLFACE PROFILE THREEQUARTERS BACK FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND
COPIES WERE TAKEN AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FINE OCCASION TO GET MONEY
BY RELICS BUT HE DID NOT PROFIT BY IT IF HE HAD SOLD HIS HAIRS FOR A
DOLLAR APIECE THERE WOULD HAVE REMAINED ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE

TO TELL THE TRUTH THIS POPULARITY DID NOT DISPLEASE HIM ON THE
CONTRARY HE PUT HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE PUBLIC AND
CORRESPONDED WITH THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE THEY REPEATED HIS WITTICISMS
ESPECIALLY THOSE HE DID NOT PERPETRATE

NOT ONLY HAD HE ALL THE MEN FOR HIM BUT THE WOMEN TOO WHAT AN INFINITE
NUMBER OF GOOD MARRIAGES HE MIGHT HAVE MADE IF HE HAD TAKEN A FANCY TO
SETTLE OLD MAIDS ESPECIALLY DREAMT BEFORE HIS PORTRAITS DAY AND
NIGHT

IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD HAVE FOUND FEMALE COMPANIONS BY HUNDREDS
EVEN IF HE HAD IMPOSED THE CONDITION OF FOLLOWING HIM UP INTO THE AIR
WOMEN ARE INTREPID WHEN THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF EVERYTHING BUT HE HAD NO
INTENTION OF TRANSPLANTING A RACE OF FRANCOAMERICANS UPON THE LUNAR
CONTINENT SO HE REFUSED

I DO NOT MEAN SAID HE TO PLAY THE PART OF ADAM WITH A DAUGHTER OF
EVE UP THERE I MIGHT MEET WITH SERPENTS

AS SOON AS HE COULD WITHDRAW FROM THE JOYS OF TRIUMPH TOO OFTEN
REPEATED HE WENT WITH HIS FRIENDS TO PAY A VISIT TO THE COLUMBIAD HE
OWED IT THAT BESIDES HE WAS GETTING VERY LEARNED IN BALLISTICS SINCE
HE HAD LIVED WITH BARBICANE JT MASTON AND TUTTI QUANTI HIS
GREATEST PLEASURE CONSISTED IN REPEATING TO THESE BRAVE ARTILLERYMEN
THAT THEY WERE ONLY AMIABLE AND LEARNED MURDERERS HE WAS ALWAYS JOKING
ABOUT IT THE DAY HE VISITED THE COLUMBIAD HE GREATLY ADMIRED IT AND
WENT DOWN TO THE BORE OF THE GIGANTIC MORTAR THAT WAS SOON TO HURL HIM
TOWARDS THE QUEEN OF NIGHT

AT LEAST SAID HE THAT CANNON WILL NOT HURT ANYBODY WHICH IS
ALREADY VERY ASTONISHING ON THE PART OF A CANNON BUT AS TO YOUR ENGINES
THAT DESTROY BURN SMASH AND KILL DONT TALK TO ME ABOUT THEM

IT IS NECESSARY TO REPORT HERE A PROPOSITION MADE BY JT MASTON WHEN
THE SECRETARY OF THE GUN CLUB HEARD BARBICANE AND NICHOLL ACCEPT MICHEL
ARDANS PROPOSITION HE RESOLVED TO JOIN THEM AND MAKE A PARTY OF FOUR
ONE DAY HE ASKED TO GO BARBICANE GRIEVED AT HAVING TO REFUSE MADE HIM
UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROJECTILE COULD NOT CARRY SO MANY PASSENGERS JT
MASTON IN DESPAIR WENT TO MICHEL ARDAN WHO ADVISED HIM TO BE
RESIGNED ADDING ONE OR TWO ARGUMENTS AD HOMINEM

YOU SEE OLD FELLOW HE SAID TO HIM YOU MUST NOT BE OFFENDED BUT
REALLY BETWEEN OURSELVES YOU ARE TOO INCOMPLETE TO PRESENT YOURSELF IN
THE MOON

INCOMPLETE CRIED THE VALIANT CRIPPLE

YES MY BRAVE FRIEND SUPPOSE WE SHOULD MEET WITH INHABITANTS UP THERE
DO YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM A SORRY IDEA OF WHAT GOES ON HERE TEACH THEM
WHAT WAR IS SHOW THEM THAT WE EMPLOY THE BEST PART OF OUR TIME IN
DEVOURING EACH OTHER AND BREAKING ARMS AND LIMBS AND THAT UPON A GLOBE
THAT COULD FEED A HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLIONS OF INHABITANTS AND WHERE
THERE ARE HARDLY TWELVE HUNDRED MILLIONS WHY MY WORTHY FRIEND YOU
WOULD HAVE US SHOWN TO THE DOOR

BUT IF YOU ARRIVE SMASHED TO PIECES REPLIED JT MASTON YOU WILL BE
AS INCOMPLETE AS I

CERTAINLY ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN BUT WE SHALL NOT ARRIVE IN PIECES

IN FACT A PREPARATORY EXPERIMENT TRIED ON THE TH OF OCTOBER HAD
BEEN ATTENDED WITH THE BEST RESULTS AND GIVEN RISE TO THE MOST
LEGITIMATE HOPES BARBICANE WISHING TO KNOW THE EFFECT OF THE SHOCK AT
THE MOMENT OF THE PROJECTILES DEPARTURE SENT FOR A INCH MORTAR FROM
PENSACOLA ARSENAL IT WAS INSTALLED UPON THE QUAY OF HILLISBORO HARBOUR
IN ORDER THAT THE BOMB MIGHT FALL INTO THE SEA AND THE SHOCK OF ITS
FALL BE DEADENED HE ONLY WISHED TO EXPERIMENT UPON THE SHOCK OF ITS
DEPARTURE NOT THAT OF ITS ARRIVAL

A HOLLOW PROJECTILE WAS PREPARED WITH THE GREATEST CARE FOR THIS CURIOUS
EXPERIMENT A THICK WADDING PUT UPON A NETWORK OF SPRINGS MADE OF THE
BEST STEEL LINED IT INSIDE IT WAS QUITE A WADDED NEST

WHAT A PITY ONE CANT GO IN IT SAID JT MASTON REGRETTING THAT HIS
SIZE DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO MAKE THE VENTURE

INTO THIS CHARMING BOMB WHICH WAS CLOSED BY MEANS OF A LID SCREWED
DOWN THEY PUT FIRST A LARGE CAT THEN A SQUIRREL BELONGING TO THE
PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE GUN CLUB WHICH JT MASTON WAS VERY FOND OF
BUT THEY WISHED TO KNOW HOW THIS LITTLE ANIMAL NOT LIKELY TO BE GIDDY
WOULD SUPPORT THIS EXPERIMENTAL JOURNEY

THE MORTAR WAS LOADED WITH  LBS OF POWDER AND THE BOMB IT WAS THEN
FIRED

THE PROJECTILE IMMEDIATELY ROSE WITH RAPIDITY DESCRIBED A MAJESTIC
PARABOLA ATTAINED A HEIGHT OF ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET AND THEN WITH A
GRACEFUL CURVE FELL INTO THE WAVES

WITHOUT LOSING AN INSTANT A VESSEL WAS SENT TO THE SPOT WHERE IT FELL
SKILFUL DIVERS SANK UNDER WATER AND FASTENED CABLECHAINS TO THE HANDLES
OF THE BOMB WHICH WAS RAPIDLY HOISTED ON BOARD FIVE MINUTES HAD NOT
ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME THE ANIMALS WERE SHUT UP AND THE UNSCREWING OF
THEIR PRISON LID

ARDAN BARBICANE MASTON AND NICHOLL WERE UPON THE VESSEL AND THEY
ASSISTED AT THE OPERATION WITH A SENTIMENT OF INTEREST EASY TO
UNDERSTAND THE BOMB WAS HARDLY OPENED BEFORE THE CAT SPRANG OUT RATHER
BRUISED BUT QUITE LIVELY AND NOT LOOKING AS IF IT HAD JUST RETURNED
FROM AN AERIAL EXPEDITION BUT NOTHING WAS SEEN OF THE SQUIRREL THE
TRUTH WAS THEN DISCOVERED THE CAT HAD EATEN ITS TRAVELLING COMPANION

JT MASTON WAS VERY GRIEVED AT THE LOSS OF HIS POOR SQUIRREL AND
PROPOSED TO INSCRIBE IT IN THE MARTYROLOGY OF SCIENCE

HOWEVER THAT MAY BE AFTER THIS EXPERIMENT ALL HESITATION AND FEAR WERE
AT AN END BESIDES BARBICANES PLANS WERE DESTINED FURTHER TO PERFECT
THE PROJECTILE AND DESTROY ALMOST ENTIRELY THE EFFECT OF THE SHOCK
THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO DO BUT TO START

TWO DAYS LATER MICHEL ARDAN RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNION AN HONOUR WHICH HE MUCH APPRECIATED

AFTER THE EXAMPLE OF HIS CHIVALROUS COUNTRYMAN LA FAYETTE THE
GOVERNMENT HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM THE TITLE OF CITIZEN OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA




CHAPTER XXIII

THE PROJECTILE COMPARTMENT


AFTER THE CELEBRATED COLUMBIAD WAS COMPLETED PUBLIC INTEREST IMMEDIATELY
CENTRED UPON THE PROJECTILE THE NEW VEHICLE DESTINED TO TRANSPORT THE
THREE BOLD ADVENTURERS ACROSS SPACE NO ONE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT IN HIS
DESPATCH OF SEPTEMBER TH MICHEL ARDAN ASKED FOR A MODIFICATION OF THE
PLANS LAID OUT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

PRESIDENT BARBICANE THEN THOUGHT WITH REASON THAT THE FORM OF THE
PROJECTILE WAS OF SLIGHT IMPORTANCE FOR AFTER CROSSING THE ATMOSPHERE
IN A FEW SECONDS IT WOULD MEET WITH VACUUM THE COMMITTEE HAD THEREFORE
CHOSEN THE ROUND FORM SO THAT THE BALL MIGHT TURN OVER AND OVER AND DO
AS IT LIKED BUT AS SOON AS IT HAD TO BE MADE INTO A VEHICLE THAT WAS
ANOTHER THING MICHEL ARDAN DID NOT WANT TO TRAVEL SQUIRRELFASHION HE
WISHED TO GO UP HEAD UP AND FEET DOWN WITH AS MUCH DIGNITY AS IN THE CAR
OF A BALLOON QUICKER OF COURSE BUT WITHOUT UNSEEMLY GAMBOLS

NEW PLANS WERE THEREFORE SENT TO THE FIRM OF BREADWILL AND CO OF
ALBANY WITH THE RECOMMENDATION TO EXECUTE THEM WITHOUT DELAY THE
PROJECTILE THUS MODIFIED WAS CAST ON THE ND OF NOVEMBER AND SENT
IMMEDIATELY TO STONY HILL BY THE EASTERN RAILWAY

ON THE TH IT ARRIVED WITHOUT ACCIDENT AT ITS PLACE OF DESTINATION
MICHEL ARDAN BARBICANE AND NICHOLL AWAITED WITH THE MOST LIVELY
IMPATIENCE THIS PROJECTILE COMPARTMENT IN WHICH THEY WERE TO TAKE
THEIR PASSAGE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW WORLD

IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF METAL A
METALLURGIC PRODUCTION THAT DID THE GREATEST HONOUR TO THE INDUSTRIAL
GENIUS OF THE AMERICANS IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT ALUMINIUM HAD BEEN
OBTAINED IN SO LARGE A MASS WHICH RESULT MIGHT BE JUSTLY REGARDED AS
PRODIGIOUS THIS PRECIOUS PROJECTILE SPARKLED IN THE RAYS OF THE SUN
SEEING IT IN ITS IMPOSING SHAPE WITH ITS CONICAL TOP IT MIGHT EASILY
HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THOSE EXTINGUISHERSHAPED TOWERS THAT
ARCHITECTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES PUT AT THE ANGLES OF THEIR CASTLES IT
ONLY WANTED LOOPHOLES AND A WEATHERCOCK

I EXPECT EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN TO SEE A MAN ARMED CAPAPIE COME
OUT OF IT WE SHALL BE LIKE FEUDAL LORDS IN THERE WITH A LITTLE
ARTILLERY WE COULD HOLD OUR OWN AGAINST A WHOLE ARMY OF SELENITESTHAT
IS IF THERE ARE ANY IN THE MOON

THEN THE VEHICLE PLEASES YOU ASKED BARBICANE

YES YES CERTAINLY ANSWERED MICHEL ARDAN WHO WAS EXAMINING IT AS AN
ARTIST I ONLY REGRET THAT ITS FORM IS NOT A LITTLE MORE SLENDER ITS
CONE MORE GRACEFUL IT OUGHT TO BE TERMINATED BY A METAL GROUP SOME
GOTHIC ORNAMENT A SALAMANDER ESCAPING FROM IT WITH OUTSPREAD WINGS AND
OPEN BEAK

WHAT WOULD BE THE USE SAID BARBICANE WHOSE POSITIVE MIND WAS LITTLE
SENSITIVE TO THE BEAUTIES OF ART

AH FRIEND BARBICANE I AM AFRAID YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THE USE OR
YOU WOULD NOT ASK

WELL TELL ME AT ALL EVENTS MY BRAVE COMPANION

WELL MY FRIEND I THINK WE OUGHT ALWAYS TO PUT A LITTLE ART IN ALL WE
DO DO YOU KNOW AN INDIAN PLAY CALLED THE CHILDS CHARIOT

NOT EVEN BY NAME ANSWERED BARBICANE

I AM NOT SURPRISED AT THAT CONTINUED MICHEL ARDAN LEARN THEN THAT
IN THAT PLAY THERE IS A ROBBER WHO WHEN IN THE ACT OF PIERCING THE WALL
OF A HOUSE STOPS TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHALL MAKE HIS HOLE IN THE
SHAPE OF A LYRE A FLOWER OR A BIRD WELL TELL ME FRIEND BARBICANE
IF AT THAT EPOCH YOU HAD BEEN HIS JUDGE WOULD YOU HAVE CONDEMNED THAT
ROBBER

WITHOUT HESITATION ANSWERED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB AND AS A
BURGLAR TOO

WELL I SHOULD HAVE ACQUITTED HIM FRIEND BARBICANE THAT IS WHY YOU
COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ME

I WILL NOT EVEN TRY MY VALIANT ARTIST

BUT AT LEAST CONTINUED MICHEL ARDAN AS THE EXTERIOR OF OUR
PROJECTILE COMPARTMENT LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED I SHALL BE ALLOWED TO
FURNISH THE INSIDE AS I CHOOSE AND WITH ALL LUXURY SUITABLE TO
AMBASSADORS FROM THE EARTH

ABOUT THAT MY BRAVE MICHEL ANSWERED BARBICANE YOU CAN DO ENTIRELY
AS YOU PLEASE

BUT BEFORE PASSING TO THE AGREEABLE THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAD
THOUGHT OF THE USEFUL AND THE MEANS HE HAD INVENTED FOR LESSENING THE
EFFECTS OF THE SHOCK WERE APPLIED WITH PERFECT INTELLIGENCE

BARBICANE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF NOT UNREASONABLY THAT NO SPRING WOULD BE
SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL TO DEADEN THE SHOCK AND DURING HIS FAMOUS
PROMENADE IN SKERSNAW WOOD HE HAD ENDED BY SOLVING THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY
IN AN INGENIOUS FASHION HE DEPENDED UPON WATER TO RENDER HIM THIS
SIGNAL SERVICE THIS IS HOW

THE PROJECTILE WAS TO BE FILLED TO THE DEPTH OF THREE FEET WITH WATER
DESTINED TO SUPPORT A WATERTIGHT WOODEN DISC WHICH EASILY WORKED
WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE PROJECTILE IT WAS UPON THIS RAFT THAT THE
TRAVELLERS WERE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE AS TO THE LIQUID MASS IT WAS
DIVIDED BY HORIZONTAL PARTITIONS WHICH THE DEPARTING SHOCK WOULD
SUCCESSIVELY BREAK THEN EACH SHEET OF WATER FROM THE LOWEST TO THE
HIGHEST ESCAPING BY VALVES IN THE UPPER PART OF THE PROJECTILE THUS
MAKING A SPRING AND THE DISC ITSELF FURNISHED WITH EXTREMELY POWERFUL
BUFFERS COULD NOT STRIKE THE BOTTOM UNTIL IT HAD SUCCESSIVELY BROKEN
THE DIFFERENT PARTITIONS THE TRAVELLERS WOULD DOUBTLESS FEEL A VIOLENT
RECOIL AFTER THE COMPLETE ESCAPE OF THE LIQUID MASS BUT THE FIRST SHOCK
WOULD BE ALMOST ENTIRELY DEADENED BY SO POWERFUL A SPRING

IT IS TRUE THAT THREE FEET ON A SURFACE OF  SQUARE FEET WOULD WEIGH
NEARLY  LBS BUT THE ESCAPE OF GAS ACCUMULATED IN THE COLUMBIAD
WOULD SUFFICE BARBICANE THOUGHT TO CONQUER THAT INCREASE OF WEIGHT
BESIDES THE SHOCK WOULD SEND OUT ALL THAT WATER IN LESS THAN A SECOND
AND THE PROJECTILE WOULD SOON REGAIN ITS NORMAL WEIGHT

THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAD IMAGINED AND HOW HE
THOUGHT HE HAD SOLVED THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE RECOIL THIS WORK
INTELLIGENTLY COMPREHENDED BY THE ENGINEERS OF THE BREADWILL FIRM WAS
MARVELLOUSLY EXECUTED THE EFFECT ONCE PRODUCED AND THE WATER GONE THE
TRAVELLERS COULD EASILY GET RID OF THE BROKEN PARTITIONS AND TAKE AWAY
THE MOBILE DISC THAT BORE THEM AT THE MOMENT OF DEPARTURE

AS TO THE UPPER SIDES OF THE PROJECTILE THEY WERE LINED WITH A THICK
WADDING OF LEATHER PUT UPON THE BEST STEEL SPRINGS AS SUPPLE AS
WATCHSPRINGS THE ESCAPEPIPES HIDDEN UNDER THIS WADDING WERE NOT EVEN
SEEN

ALL IMAGINABLE PRECAUTIONS FOR DEADENING THE FIRST SHOCK HAVING BEEN
TAKEN MICHEL ARDAN SAID THEY MUST BE MADE OF VERY BAD STUFF TO BE
CRUSHED

THE PROJECTILE OUTSIDE WAS NINE FEET WIDE AND TWELVE FEET HIGH IN ORDER
NOT TO PASS THE WEIGHT ASSIGNED THE SIDES HAD BEEN MADE A LITTLE LESS
THICK AND THE BOTTOM THICKER AS IT WOULD HAVE TO SUPPORT ALL THE
VIOLENCE OF THE GASES DEVELOPED BY THE DEFLAGRATION OF THE PYROXYLE
BOMBS AND CYLINDROCONICAL HOWITZERS ARE ALWAYS MADE WITH THICKER
BOTTOMS

THE ENTRANCE TO THIS TOWER OF METAL WAS A NARROW OPENING IN THE WALL OF
THE CONE LIKE THE MANHOLE OF STEAM BOILERS IT CLOSED HERMETICALLY
BY MEANS OF AN ALUMINIUM PLATE FASTENED INSIDE BY POWERFUL SCREW
PRESSURE THE TRAVELLERS COULD THEREFORE LEAVE THEIR MOBILE PRISON AT
WILL AS SOON AS THEY HAD REACHED THE QUEEN OF NIGHT

BUT GOING WAS NOT EVERYTHING IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEE ON THE ROAD
NOTHING WAS EASIER IN FACT UNDER THE WADDING WERE FOUR THICK
LENTICULAR FOOTLIGHTS TWO LET INTO THE CIRCULAR WALL OF THE PROJECTILE
THE THIRD IN ITS LOWER PART AND THE FOURTH IN ITS CONE THE TRAVELLERS
COULD THEREFORE OBSERVE DURING THEIR JOURNEY THE EARTH THEY WERE
LEAVING THE MOON THEY WERE APPROACHING AND THE CONSTELLATED SPACES OF
THE SKY THESE SKYLIGHTS WERE PROTECTED AGAINST THE SHOCKS OF DEPARTURE
BY PLATES LET INTO SOLID GROOVES WHICH IT WAS EASY TO MOVE BY
UNSCREWING THEM BY THAT MEANS THE AIR CONTAINED IN THE PROJECTILE COULD
NOT ESCAPE AND IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS

ALL THESE MECHANICAL APPLIANCES ADMIRABLY SET WORKED WITH THE GREATEST
EASE AND THE ENGINEERS HAD NOT SHOWN THEMSELVES LESS INTELLIGENT IN THE
ARRANGEMENT OF THE PROJECTILE COMPARTMENT

LOCKERS SOLIDLY FASTENED WERE DESTINED TO CONTAIN THE WATER AND
PROVISIONS NECESSARY FOR THE THREE TRAVELLERS THEY COULD EVEN PROCURE
THEMSELVES FIRE AND LIGHT BY MEANS OF GAS STORED UP IN A SPECIAL CASE
UNDER A PRESSURE OF SEVERAL ATMOSPHERES ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS TO TURN
A TAP AND THE GAS WOULD LIGHT AND WARM THIS COMFORTABLE VEHICLE FOR SIX
DAYS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT NONE OF THE THINGS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE OR EVEN
TO COMFORT WERE WANTING MORE THANKS TO THE INSTINCTS OF MICHEL ARDAN
THE AGREEABLE WAS JOINED TO THE USEFUL UNDER THE FORM OF OBJECTS OF ART
HE WOULD HAVE MADE A VERITABLE ARTISTS STUDIO OF HIS PROJECTILE IF ROOM
HAD NOT BEEN WANTING IT WOULD BE MISTAKEN TO SUPPOSE THAT THREE PERSONS
WOULD BE RESTRICTED FOR SPACE IN THAT METAL TOWER IT HAD A SURFACE OF
 SQUARE FEET AND WAS NEARLY  FEET HIGH AND ALLOWED ITS OCCUPIERS A
CERTAIN LIBERTY OF MOVEMENT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO MUCH AT THEIR
EASE IN THE MOST COMFORTABLE RAILWAY COMPARTMENT OF THE UNITED STATES

THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS AND LIGHTING HAVING BEEN SOLVED THERE
REMAINED THE QUESTION OF AIR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE AIR CONFINED IN
THE PROJECTILE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE TRAVELLERS RESPIRATION
FOR FOUR DAYS EACH MAN IN FACT CONSUMES IN ONE HOUR ALL THE OXYGEN
CONTAINED IN  LITRES OF AIR BARBICANE HIS TWO COMPANIONS AND TWO
DOGS THAT HE MEANT TO TAKE WOULD CONSUME EVERY TWENTYFOUR HOURS 
LITRES OF OXYGEN OR A WEIGHT EQUAL TO  LBS THE AIR IN THE PROJECTILE
MUST THEREFORE BE RENEWED HOW BY A VERY SIMPLE METHOD THAT OF
MESSRS REISET AND REGNAULT INDICATED BY MICHEL ARDAN DURING THE
DISCUSSION OF THE MEETING

IT IS KNOWN THAT THE AIR IS COMPOSED PRINCIPALLY OF TWENTYONE PARTS OF
OXYGEN AND SEVENTYNINE PARTS OF AZOTE NOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ACT OF
RESPIRATION A VERY SIMPLE PHENOMENON MAN ABSORBS THE OXYGEN OF THE
AIR EMINENTLY ADAPTED FOR SUSTAINING LIFE AND THROWS OUT THE AZOTE
INTACT THE AIR BREATHED OUT HAS LOST NEARLY FIVE PER CENT OF ITS
OXYGEN AND THEN CONTAINS A NEARLY EQUAL VOLUME OF CARBONIC ACID THE
DEFINITIVE PRODUCT OF THE COMBUSTION OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE BLOOD BY THE
OXYGEN BREATHED IN IT IT HAPPENS THEREFORE THAT IN A CONFINED SPACE
AND AFTER A CERTAIN TIME ALL THE OXYGEN OF THE AIR IS REPLACED BY
CARBONIC ACID AN ESSENTIALLY DELETERIOUS GAS

THE QUESTION WAS THEN REDUCED TO THIS THE AZOTE BEING CONSERVED
INTACT TO REMAKE THE OXYGEN ABSORBED  TO DESTROY THE CARBONIC
ACID BREATHED OUT NOTHING EASIER TO DO BY MEANS OF CHLORATE OF POTASH
AND CAUSTIC POTASH THE FORMER IS A SALT WHICH APPEARS UNDER THE FORM OF
WHITE CRYSTALS WHEN HEATED TO A TEMPERATURE OF DEG IT IS TRANSFORMED
INTO CHLORINE OF POTASSIUM AND THE OXYGEN WHICH IT CONTAINS IS GIVEN
OFF FREELY NOW  LBS OF CHLORATE OF POTASH GIVE  LBS OF OXYGENTHAT
IS TO SAY THE QUANTITY NECESSARY TO THE TRAVELLERS FOR TWENTYFOUR
HOURS

AS TO CAUSTIC POTASH IT HAS A GREAT AFFINITY FOR CARBONIC ACID MIXED IN
AIR AND IT IS SUFFICIENT TO SHAKE IT IN ORDER FOR IT TO SEIZE UPON THE
ACID AND FORM BICARBONATE OF POTASH SO MUCH FOR THE ABSORPTION OF
CARBONIC ACID

BY COMBINING THESE TWO METHODS THEY WERE CERTAIN OF GIVING BACK TO
VITIATED AIR ALL ITS LIFEGIVING QUALITIES THE TWO CHEMISTS MESSRS
REISET AND REGNAULT HAD MADE THE EXPERIMENT WITH SUCCESS

BUT IT MUST BE SAID THE EXPERIMENT HAD ONLY BEEN MADE IN ANIMA VILI
WHATEVER ITS SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY MIGHT BE NO ONE KNEW HOW MAN COULD
BEAR IT

SUCH WAS THE OBSERVATION MADE AT THE MEETING WHERE THIS GRAVE QUESTION
WAS DISCUSSED MICHEL ARDAN MEANT TO LEAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE
POSSIBILITY OF LIVING BY MEANS OF THIS ARTIFICIAL AIR AND HE OFFERED TO
MAKE THE TRIAL BEFORE THE DEPARTURE

BUT THE HONOUR OF PUTTING IT TO THE PROOF WAS ENERGETICALLY CLAIMED BY
JT MASTON

AS I AM NOT GOING WITH YOU SAID THE BRAVE ARTILLERYMAN THE LEAST I
CAN DO WILL BE TO LIVE IN THE PROJECTILE FOR A WEEK

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNGRACIOUS TO REFUSE HIM HIS WISH WAS COMPLIED WITH
A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF CHLORATE OF POTASH AND CAUSTIC POTASH WAS
PLACED AT HIS DISPOSITION WITH PROVISIONS FOR A WEEK THEN HAVING
SHAKEN HANDS WITH HIS FRIENDS ON THE TH OF NOVEMBER AT  AM AFTER
HAVING EXPRESSLY RECOMMENDED THEM NOT TO OPEN HIS PRISON BEFORE THE TH
AT  PM HE CREPT INTO THE PROJECTILE THE IRON PLATE OF WHICH WAS
HERMETICALLY SHUT

WHAT HAPPENED DURING THAT WEEK IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN THE
THICKNESS OF THE PROJECTILES WALLS PREVENTED ANY INTERIOR NOISE FROM
REACHING THE OUTSIDE

ON THE TH OF NOVEMBER AT SIX OCLOCK PRECISELY THE PLATE WAS
REMOVED THE FRIENDS OF JT MASTON WERE RATHER UNEASY BUT THEY WERE
PROMPTLY REASSURED BY HEARING A JOYFUL VOICE SHOUTING A FORMIDABLE
HURRAH

THE SECRETARY OF THE GUN CLUB APPEARED ON THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE IN A
TRIUMPHANT ATTITUDE

HE HAD GROWN FAT




CHAPTER XXIV

THE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS


ON THE TH OF OCTOBER OF THE PRECEDING YEAR AFTER THE SUBSCRIPTION
LIST WAS CLOSED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAD CREDITED THE
CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY WITH THE SUMS NECESSARY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
VAST OPTICAL INSTRUMENT THIS TELESCOPE WAS TO BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO
RENDER VISIBLE ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON AN OBJECT BEING AT LEAST NINE
FEET WIDE

THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FIELDGLASS AND A TELESCOPE
WHICH IT IS WELL TO RECALL HERE A FIELDGLASS IS COMPOSED OF A TUBE
WHICH CARRIES AT ITS UPPER EXTREMITY A CONVEX GLASS CALLED AN
OBJECTGLASS AND AT ITS LOWER EXTREMITY A SECOND GLASS CALLED OCULAR
TO WHICH THE EYE OF THE OBSERVER IS APPLIED THE RAYS FROM THE LUMINOUS
OBJECT TRAVERSE THE FIRST GLASS AND BY REFRACTION FORM AN IMAGE UPSIDE
DOWN AT ITS FOCUS THIS IMAGE IS LOOKED AT WITH THE OCULAR WHICH
MAGNIFIES IT THE TUBE OF THE FIELDGLASS IS THEREFORE CLOSED AT EACH
EXTREMITY BY THE OBJECT AND THE OCULAR GLASSES

THE TELESCOPE ON THE CONTRARY IS OPEN AT ITS UPPER EXTREMITY THE RAYS
FROM THE OBJECT OBSERVED PENETRATE FREELY INTO IT AND STRIKE A CONCAVE
METALLIC MIRRORTHAT IS TO SAY THEY ARE FOCUSSED FROM THENCE THEIR
REFLECTED RAYS MEET WITH A LITTLE MIRROR WHICH SENDS THEM BACK TO THE
OCULAR IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAGNIFY THE IMAGE PRODUCED

THUS IN FIELDGLASSES REFRACTION PLAYS THE PRINCIPAL PART AND
REFLECTION DOES IN THE TELESCOPE HENCE THE NAME OF REFRACTORS GIVEN TO
THE FORMER AND REFLECTORS GIVEN TO THE LATTER ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN
THE EXECUTION OF THESE OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS LIES IN THE MAKING OF THE
OBJECTGLASS WHETHER THEY BE MADE OF GLASS OR METALLIC MIRRORS

STILL AT THE EPOCH WHEN THE GUN CLUB MADE ITS GREAT EXPERIMENT THESE
INSTRUMENTS WERE SINGULARLY PERFECTED AND GAVE MAGNIFICENT RESULTS THE
TIME WAS FAR DISTANT WHEN GALILEO OBSERVED THE STARS WITH HIS POOR
GLASS WHICH MAGNIFIED SEVEN TIMES AT THE MOST SINCE THE TH CENTURY
OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS HAD WIDENED AND LENGTHENED IN CONSIDERABLE
PROPORTIONS AND THEY ALLOWED THE STELLAR SPACES TO BE GAUGED TO A DEPTH
UNKNOWN BEFORE AMONGST THE REFRACTING INSTRUMENTS AT WORK AT THAT
PERIOD WERE THE GLASS OF THE POULKOWA OBSERVATORY IN RUSSIA THE
OBJECTGLASS OF WHICH MEASURED  INCHES IN WIDTH THAT OF THE FRENCH
OPTICIAN LEREBOURS FURNISHED WITH AN OBJECTGLASS EQUALLY LARGE AND
LASTLY THAT OF THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY FURNISHED WITH AN OBJECTGLASS
 INCHES IN DIAMETER

AMONGST TELESCOPES TWO WERE KNOWN OF REMARKABLE POWER AND GIGANTIC
DIMENSIONS THE FIRST CONSTRUCTED BY HERSCHEL WAS  FEET IN LENGTH
AND HAD AN OBJECTGLASS OF  FEET  INCHES IT MAGNIFIED  TIMES
THE SECOND RAISED IN IRELAND AT BIRRCASTLE IN PARSONSTOWN PARK
BELONGED TO LORD ROSSE THE LENGTH OF ITS TUBE WAS  FEET AND THE WIDTH
OF ITS MIRROR  FEET IT MAGNIFIED  TIMES AND IT HAD REQUIRED AN
IMMENSE ERECTION OF MASONRY ON WHICH TO PLACE THE APPARATUS NECESSARY
FOR WORKING THE INSTRUMENT WHICH WEIGHED  TONS

BUT IT WILL BE SEEN THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THESE COLOSSAL DIMENSIONS THE
MAGNIFYING POWER OBTAINED DID NOT EXCEED  TIMES IN ROUND NUMBERS
NOW THAT POWER WOULD ONLY BRING THE MOON WITHIN  MILES AND WOULD ONLY
ALLOW OBJECTS  FEET IN DIAMETER TO BE PERCEIVED UNLESS THESE OBJECTS
WERE VERY ELONGATED

NOW IN SPACE THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH A PROJECTILE  FEET WIDE AND  LONG
SO THE MOON HAD TO BE BROUGHT WITHIN FIVE MILES AT LEAST AND FOR THAT A
MAGNIFYING POWER OF  TIMES WAS NECESSARY

SUCH WAS THE PROBLEM PROPOUNDED TO THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY THEY WERE
NOT TO BE STOPPED BY FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES SO THERE ONLY REMAINED
MATERIAL DIFFICULTIES

FIRST OF ALL THEY HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TELESCOPES AND FIELDGLASSES
THE LATTER HAD SOME ADVANTAGES WITH EQUAL OBJECTGLASSES THEY HAVE A
GREATER MAGNIFYING POWER BECAUSE THE LUMINOUS RAYS THAT TRAVERSE THE
GLASSES LOSE LESS BY ABSORPTION THAN THE REFLECTION ON THE METALLIC
MIRROR OF TELESCOPES BUT THE THICKNESS THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO GLASS IS
LIMITED FOR TOO THICK IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE LUMINOUS RAYS TO PASS
BESIDES THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE VAST GLASSES IS EXCESSIVELY
DIFFICULT AND DEMANDS A CONSIDERABLE TIME MEASURED BY YEARS

THEREFORE ALTHOUGH IMAGES ARE BETTER GIVEN BY GLASSES AN INAPPRECIABLE
ADVANTAGE WHEN THE QUESTION IS TO OBSERVE THE MOON THE LIGHT OF WHICH
IS SIMPLY REFLECTED THEY DECIDED TO EMPLOY THE TELESCOPE WHICH IS
PROMPTER IN EXECUTION AND IS CAPABLE OF A GREATER MAGNIFYING POWER ONLY
AS THE LUMINOUS RAYS LOSE MUCH OF THEIR INTENSITY BY TRAVERSING THE
ATMOSPHERE THE GUN CLUB RESOLVED TO SET UP THE INSTRUMENT ON ONE OF THE
HIGHEST MOUNTAINS OF THE UNION WHICH WOULD DIMINISH THE DEPTH OF THE
AERIAL STRATA

IN TELESCOPES IT HAS BEEN SEEN THAT THE GLASS PLACED AT THE OBSERVERS
EYE PRODUCES THE MAGNIFYING POWER AND THE OBJECTGLASS WHICH BEARS THIS
POWER THE BEST IS THE ONE THAT HAS THE LARGEST DIAMETER AND THE GREATEST
FOCAL DISTANCE IN ORDER TO MAGNIFY  TIMES IT MUST BE MUCH LARGER
THAN THOSE OF HERSCHEL AND LORD ROSSE THERE LAY THE DIFFICULTY FOR THE
CASTING OF THESE MIRRORS IS A VERY DELICATE OPERATION

HAPPILY SOME YEARS BEFORE A SAVANT OF THE INSTITUT DE FRANCE LEON
FOUCAULT HAD JUST INVENTED MEANS BY WHICH THE POLISHING OF
OBJECTGLASSES BECAME VERY PROMPT AND EASY BY REPLACING THE METALLIC
MIRROR BY TAKING A PIECE OF GLASS THE SIZE REQUIRED AND PLATING IT

IT WAS TO BE FIXED ACCORDING TO THE METHOD INVENTED BY HERSCHEL FOR
TELESCOPES IN THE GREAT INSTRUMENT OF THE ASTRONOMER AT SLOUGH THE
IMAGE OF OBJECTS REFLECTED BY THE MIRROR INCLINED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
TUBE WAS FORMED AT THE OTHER EXTREMITY WHERE THE EYEGLASS WAS PLACED
THUS THE OBSERVER INSTEAD OF BEING PLACED AT THE LOWER END OF THE TUBE
WAS HOISTED TO THE UPPER END AND THERE WITH HIS EYEGLASS HE LOOKED DOWN
INTO THE ENORMOUS CYLINDER THIS COMBINATION HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING
AWAY WITH THE LITTLE MIRROR DESTINED TO SEND BACK THE IMAGE TO THE
OCULAR GLASS WHICH THUS ONLY REFLECTED ONCE INSTEAD OF TWICE THEREFORE
THERE WERE FEWER LUMINOUS RAYS EXTINGUISHED THE IMAGE WAS LESS FEEBLE
AND MORE LIGHT WAS OBTAINED A PRECIOUS ADVANTAGE IN THE OBSERVATION
THAT WAS TO BE MADE

THIS BEING RESOLVED UPON THE WORK WAS BEGUN ACCORDING TO THE
CALCULATIONS OF THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY STAFF THE TUBE OF THE NEW
REFLECTOR WAS TO BE  FEET LONG AND ITS MIRROR  FEET IN DIAMETER
ALTHOUGH IT WAS SO COLOSSAL IT WAS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE TELESCOPE
 FEET LONG WHICH THE ASTRONOMER HOOKE PROPOSED TO CONSTRUCT SOME
YEARS AGO NEVERTHELESS THE SETTING UP OF SUCH AN APPARATUS PRESENTED
GREAT DIFFICULTIES

THE QUESTION OF ITS SITE WAS PROMPTLY SETTLED IT MUST BE UPON A HIGH
MOUNTAIN AND HIGH MOUNTAINS ARE NOT NUMEROUS IN THE STATES

IN FACT THE OROGRAPHICAL SYSTEM OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY ONLY CONTAINS TWO
CHAINS OF AVERAGE HEIGHT AMONGST WHICH FLOWS THE MAGNIFICENT
MISSISSIPPI WHICH THE AMERICANS WOULD CALL THE KING OF RIVERS IF THEY
ADMITTED ANY ROYALTY WHATEVER

ON THE EAST RISE THE APALACHIANS THE VERY HIGHEST POINT OF WHICH IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE DOES NOT EXCEED THE VERY MODERATE ALTITUDE OF  FEET

ON THE WEST ARE HOWEVER THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THAT IMMENSE CHAIN WHICH
BEGINS AT THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN FOLLOWS THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH
AMERICA UNDER THE NAME OF THE ANDES OR CORDILLERAS CROSSES THE ISTHMUS
OF PANAMA AND RUNS UP THE WHOLE OF NORTH AMERICA TO THE VERY SHORES OF
THE POLAR SEA

THESE MOUNTAINS ARE NOT VERY HIGH AND THE ALPS OR HIMALAYAS WOULD LOOK
DOWN UPON THEM WITH DISDAIN IN FACT THEIR HIGHEST SUMMIT IS ONLY
 FEET HIGH WHILST MONT BLANC IS  AND THE HIGHEST SUMMIT OF
THE HIMALAYAS IS  FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA

BUT AS THE GUN CLUB WISHED THAT ITS TELESCOPE AS WELL AS THE COLUMBIAD
SHOULD BE SET UP IN THE STATES OF THE UNION THEY WERE OBLIGED TO BE
CONTENT WITH THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND ALL THE NECESSARY MATERIAL WAS
SENT TO THE SUMMIT OF LONGS PEAK IN THE TERRITORY OF MISSOURI

NEITHER PEN NOR LANGUAGE COULD RELATE THE DIFFICULTIES OF EVERY KIND
THAT THE AMERICAN ENGINEERS HAD TO OVERCOME AND THE PRODIGIES OF
AUDACITY AND SKILL THAT THEY ACCOMPLISHED ENORMOUS STONES MASSIVE
PIECES OF WROUGHTIRON HEAVY CORNERCLAMPS AND HUGE PORTIONS OF
CYLINDER HAD TO BE RAISED WITH AN OBJECTGLASS WEIGHING NEARLY 
LBS ABOVE THE LINE OF PERPETUAL SNOW FOR MORE THAN  FEET IN
HEIGHT AFTER CROSSING DESERT PRAIRIES IMPENETRABLE FORESTS FEARFUL
RAPIDS FAR FROM ALL CENTRES OF POPULATION AND IN THE MIDST OF SAVAGE
REGIONS IN WHICH EVERY DETAIL OF LIFE BECOMES AN INSOLUBLE PROBLEM AND
NEVERTHELESS AMERICAN GENIUS TRIUMPHED OVER ALL THESE OBSTACLES LESS
THAN A YEAR AFTER BEGINNING THE WORKS IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE MONTH OF
SEPTEMBER THE GIGANTIC REFLECTOR ROSE IN THE AIR TO A HEIGHT OF 
FEET IT WAS HUNG FROM AN ENORMOUS IRON SCAFFOLDING AN INGENIOUS
ARRANGEMENT ALLOWED IT TO BE EASILY MOVED TOWARDS EVERY POINT OF THE
SKY AND TO FOLLOW THE STARS FROM ONE HORIZON TO THE OTHER DURING THEIR
JOURNEY ACROSS SPACE

IT HAD COST MORE THAN  DOLLARS THE FIRST TIME IT WAS POINTED AT
THE MOON THE OBSERVERS FELT BOTH CURIOUS AND UNEASY WHAT WOULD THEY
DISCOVER IN THE FIELD OF THIS TELESCOPE WHICH MAGNIFIED OBJECTS 
TIMES POPULATIONS FLOCKS OF LUNAR ANIMALS TOWNS LAKES AND OCEANS
NO NOTHING THAT SCIENCE WAS NOT ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH AND UPON ALL
POINTS OF HER DISC THE VOLCANIC NATURE OF THE MOON COULD BE DETERMINED
WITH ABSOLUTE PRECISION

BUT THE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS BEFORE BEING USED BY THE GUN
CLUB RENDERED IMMENSE SERVICES TO ASTRONOMY THANKS TO ITS POWER OF
PENETRATION THE DEPTHS OF THE SKY WERE EXPLORED TO THEIR UTMOST LIMITS
THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF A GREAT NUMBER OF STARS COULD BE RIGOROUSLY
MEASURED AND MR CLARKE OF THE CAMBRIDGE STAFF RESOLVED THE CRAB
NEBULA IN TAURUS WHICH LORD ROSSES REFLECTOR HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
DO




CHAPTER XXV

FINAL DETAILS


IT WAS THE ND OF NOVEMBER THE SUPREME DEPARTURE WAS TO TAKE PLACE TEN
DAYS LATER ONE OPERATION STILL REMAINED TO BRING IT TO A HAPPY
TERMINATION A DELICATE AND PERILOUS OPERATION EXACTING INFINITE
PRECAUTIONS AND AGAINST THE SUCCESS OF WHICH CAPTAIN NICHOLL HAD LAID
HIS THIRD BET IT WAS IN FACT NOTHING LESS THAN THE LOADING OF THE GUN
AND THE INTRODUCTION INTO IT OF  LBS OF GUNCOTTON NICHOLL HAD
THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT REASON PERHAPS THAT THE HANDLING OF SO LARGE A
QUANTITY OF PYROXYLE WOULD CAUSE GRAVE CATASTROPHES AND THAT IN ANY
CASE THIS EMINENTLY EXPLOSIVE MASS WOULD IGNITE OF ITSELF UNDER THE
PRESSURE OF THE PROJECTILE

THERE WERE ALSO GRAVE DANGERS INCREASED BY THE CARELESSNESS OF THE
AMERICANS WHO DURING THE FEDERAL WAR USED TO LOAD THEIR CANNON CIGAR
IN MOUTH BUT BARBICANE HAD SET HIS HEART ON SUCCEEDING AND DID NOT
MEAN TO FOUNDER IN PORT HE THEREFORE CHOSE HIS BEST WORKMEN MADE THEM
WORK UNDER HIS SUPERINTENDENCE AND BY DINT OF PRUDENCE AND PRECAUTIONS
HE MANAGED TO PUT ALL THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS ON HIS SIDE

FIRST HE TOOK CARE NOT TO BRING ALL HIS CHARGE AT ONCE TO THE INCLOSURE
OF STONY HILL HE HAD IT BROUGHT LITTLE BY LITTLE CAREFULLY PACKED IN
SEALED CASES THE  LBS OF PYROXYLE HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO PACKETS
OF  LBS WHICH MADE  LARGE CARTRIDGES MADE CAREFULLY BY THE
CLEVEREST ARTISANS OF PENSACOLA EACH CASE CONTAINED TEN AND THEY
ARRIVED ONE AFTER THE OTHER BY THE RAILROAD OF TAMPA TOWN BY THAT MEANS
THERE WERE NEVER MORE THAN  LBS OF PYROXYLE AT ONCE IN THE
INCLOSURE AS SOON AS IT ARRIVED EACH CASE WAS UNLOADED BY WORKMEN
WALKING BAREFOOT AND EACH CARTRIDGE TRANSPORTED TO THE ORIFICE OF THE
COLUMBIAD INTO WHICH THEY LOWERED THEM BY MEANS OF CRANES WORKED BY THE
MEN EVERY STEAMENGINE HAD BEEN EXCLUDED AND THE LEAST FIRES
EXTINGUISHED FOR TWO MILES ROUND EVEN IN NOVEMBER IT WAS NECESSARY TO
PRESERVE THIS GUNCOTTON FROM THE ARDOUR OF THE SUN SO THEY WORKED AT
NIGHT BY LIGHT PRODUCED IN A VACUUM BY MEANS OF RUHMKORFFS APPARATUS
WHICH THREW AN ARTIFICIAL BRIGHTNESS INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE COLUMBIAD
THERE THE CARTRIDGES WERE ARRANGED WITH THE UTMOST REGULARITY FASTENED
TOGETHER BY A WIRE DESTINED TO COMMUNICATE THE ELECTRIC SPARK TO THEM
ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY

IN FACT IT WAS BY MEANS OF ELECTRICITY THAT FIRE WAS TO BE SET TO THIS
MASS OF GUNCOTTON ALL THESE SINGLE WIRES SURROUNDED BY ISOLATING
MATERIAL WERE ROLLED INTO A SINGLE ONE AT A NARROW HOLE PIERCED AT THE
HEIGHT THE PROJECTILE WAS TO BE PLACED THERE THEY CROSSED THE THICK
METAL WALL AND CAME UP TO THE SURFACE BY ONE OF THE VENTHOLES IN THE
MASONRY MADE ON PURPOSE ONCE ARRIVED AT THE SUMMIT OF STONY HILL THE
WIRE SUPPORTED ON POLES FOR A DISTANCE OF TWO MILES MET A POWERFUL PILE
OF BUNSEN PASSING THROUGH A NONCONDUCTING APPARATUS IT WOULD
THEREFORE BE ENOUGH TO PRESS WITH THE FINGER THE KNOB OF THE APPARATUS
FOR THE ELECTRIC CURRENT TO BE AT ONCE ESTABLISHED AND TO SET FIRE TO
THE  LBS OF GUNCOTTON IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY THAT THIS
WAS ONLY TO BE DONE AT THE LAST MOMENT

ON THE TH OF NOVEMBER THE  CARTRIDGES WERE PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE COLUMBIAD THAT PART OF THE OPERATION HAD SUCCEEDED BUT WHAT WORRY
ANXIETY AND STRUGGLES PRESIDENT BARBICANE HAD TO UNDERGO IN VAIN HAD
HE FORBIDDEN ENTRANCE TO STONY HILL EVERY DAY CURIOUS SIGHTSEERS
CLIMBED OVER THE PALISADING AND SOME PUSHING IMPRUDENCE TO FOLLY CAME
AND SMOKED AMONGST THE BALES OF GUNCOTTON BARBICANE PUT HIMSELF INTO
DAILY RAGES JT MASTON SECONDED HIM TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
CHASING THE INTRUDERS AWAY AND PICKING UP THE STILLLIGHTED CIGARENDS
WHICH THE YANKEES THREW ABOUTA RUDE TASK FOR MORE THAN  PEOPLE
PRESSED ROUND THE PALISADES MICHEL ARDAN HAD OFFERED HIMSELF TO ESCORT
THE CASES TO THE MOUTH OF THE GUN BUT HAVING CAUGHT HIM WITH A CIGAR IN
HIS MOUTH WHILST HE DROVE OUT THE INTRUDERS TO WHOM HE WAS GIVING THIS
UNFORTUNATE EXAMPLE THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB SAW THAT HE COULD NOT
DEPEND UPON THIS INTREPID SMOKER AND WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE HIM SPECIALLY
WATCHED

AT LAST THERE BEING A PROVIDENCE EVEN FOR ARTILLERYMEN NOTHING BLEW
UP AND THE LOADING WAS HAPPILY TERMINATED THE THIRD BET OF CAPTAIN
NICHOLL WAS THEREFORE MUCH IMPERILLED THERE STILL REMAINED THE WORK OF
INTRODUCING THE PROJECTILE INTO THE COLUMBIAD AND PLACING IT ON THE
THICK BED OF GUNCOTTON

BUT BEFORE BEGINNING THIS OPERATION THE OBJECTS NECESSARY FOR THE
JOURNEY WERE PLACED WITH ORDER IN THE WAGGONCOMPARTMENT THERE WERE A
GOOD MANY OF THEM AND IF THEY HAD ALLOWED MICHEL ARDAN TO DO AS HE
PLEASED HE WOULD SOON HAVE FILLED UP ALL THE SPACE RESERVED FOR THE
TRAVELLERS NO ONE CAN IMAGINE ALL THAT THE AMIABLE FRENCHMAN WISHED TO
CARRY TO THE MOONA HEAP OF USELESS TRIFLES BUT BARBICANE INTERFERED
AND REFUSED ALL BUT THE STRICTLY NECESSARY

SEVERAL THERMOMETERS BAROMETERS AND TELESCOPES WERE PLACED IN THE
INSTRUMENTCASE

THE TRAVELLERS WERE DESIROUS OF EXAMINING THE MOON DURING THEIR TRANSIT
AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE SURVEY OF THIS NEW WORLD THEY TOOK AN
EXCELLENT MAP BY BOEER AND MOEDLER THE MAPPA SELENOGRAPHICA
PUBLISHED IN FOUR PLATES WHICH IS JUSTLY LOOKED UPON AS A MASTERPIECE
OF PATIENCE AND OBSERVATION IT REPRESENTED WITH SCRUPULOUS EXACTITUDE
THE SLIGHTEST DETAILS OF THAT PORTION OF THE MOON TURNED TOWARDS THE
EARTH MOUNTAINS VALLEYS CRATERS PEAKS WATERSHEDS WERE DEPICTED ON
IT IN THEIR EXACT DIMENSIONS FAITHFUL POSITIONS AND NAMES FROM MOUNTS
DOERFEL AND LEIBNITZ WHOSE HIGHEST SUMMITS RISE ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF
THE DISC TO THE MARE FRIGORIS WHICH EXTENDS INTO THE NORTH POLAR
REGIONS

IT WAS THEREFORE A PRECIOUS DOCUMENT FOR THE TRAVELLERS FOR THEY
COULD STUDY THE COUNTRY BEFORE SETTING FOOT UPON IT

THEY TOOK ALSO THREE RIFLES AND THREE FOWLINGPIECES WITH POWDER AND
SHOT IN GREAT QUANTITY

WE DO NOT KNOW WITH WHOM WE MAY HAVE TO DEAL SAID MICHEL ARDAN BOTH
MEN AND BEASTS MAY BE DISPLEASED AT OUR VISIT WE MUST THEREFORE TAKE
OUR PRECAUTIONS

THE INSTRUMENTS OF PERSONAL DEFENCE WERE ACCOMPANIED BY PICKAXES
SPADES SAWS AND OTHER INDISPENSABLE TOOLS WITHOUT MENTIONING GARMENTS
SUITABLE TO EVERY TEMPERATURE FROM THE COLD OF THE POLAR REGIONS TO THE
HEAT OF THE TORRID ZONE

MICHEL ARDAN WOULD HAVE LIKED TO TAKE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ANIMALS OF
DIFFERENT SORTS NOT MALE AND FEMALE OF EVERY SPECIES AS HE DID NOT SEE
THE NECESSITY OF ACCLIMATISING SERPENTS TIGERS ALLIGATORS OR ANY
OTHER NOXIOUS BEASTS IN THE MOON

NO SAID HE TO BARBICANE BUT SOME USEFUL ANIMALS OX OR COW ASS OR
HORSE WOULD LOOK WELL IN THE LANDSCAPE AND BE OF GREAT USE

I AGREE WITH YOU MY DEAR ARDAN ANSWERED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN
CLUB BUT OUR PROJECTILE IS NOT NOAHS ARK IT DIFFERS BOTH IN
DIMENSIONS AND OBJECT SO LET US REMAIN IN THE BOUNDS OF POSSIBILITY

AT LAST AFTER LONG DISCUSSIONS IT WAS AGREED THAT THE TRAVELLERS SHOULD
BE CONTENT TO TAKE WITH THEM AN EXCELLENT SPORTING DOG BELONGING TO
NICHOLL AND A VIGOROUS NEWFOUNDLAND OF PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH SEVERAL
CASES OF THE MOST USEFUL SEEDS WERE INCLUDED AMONGST THE INDISPENSABLE
OBJECTS IF THEY HAD ALLOWED HIM MICHEL ARDAN WOULD HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL
SACKS OF EARTH TO SOW THEM IN ANY WAY HE TOOK A DOZEN LITTLE TREES
WHICH WERE CAREFULLY ENVELOPED IN STRAW AND PLACED IN A CORNER OF THE
PROJECTILE

THEN REMAINED THE IMPORTANT QUESTION OF PROVISIONS FOR THEY WERE
OBLIGED TO PROVIDE AGAINST FINDING THE MOON ABSOLUTELY BARREN BARBICANE
MANAGED SO WELL THAT HE TOOK ENOUGH FOR A YEAR BUT IT MUST BE ADDED TO
PREVENT ASTONISHMENT THAT THESE PROVISIONS CONSISTED OF MEAT AND
VEGETABLE COMPRESSED TO THEIR SMALLEST VOLUME BY HYDRAULIC PRESSURE AND
INCLUDED A GREAT QUANTITY OF NUTRITIVE ELEMENTS THERE WAS NOT MUCH
VARIETY BUT IT WOULD NOT DO TO BE TOO PARTICULAR IN SUCH AN EXPEDITION
THERE WAS ALSO ABOUT FIFTY GALLONS OF BRANDY AND WATER FOR TWO MONTHS
ONLY FOR ACCORDING TO THE LATEST OBSERVATIONS OF ASTRONOMERS NO ONE
DOUBTED THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE MOON AS TO
PROVISIONS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSANE TO BELIEVE THAT THE INHABITANTS OF
THE EARTH WOULD NOT FIND FOOD UP THERE MICHEL ARDAN HAD NO DOUBT ABOUT
IT IF HE HAD HE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE

BESIDES SAID HE ONE DAY TO HIS FRIENDS WE SHALL NOT BE COMPLETELY
ABANDONED BY OUR FRIENDS ON EARTH AND THEY WILL TAKE CARE NOT TO FORGET
US

NO CERTAINLY ANSWERED JT MASTON

WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED NICHOLL

NOTHING MORE SIMPLE ANSWERED ARDAN WILL NOT OUR COLUMBIAD BE STILL
THERE WELL THEN EVERY TIME THAT THE MOON IS IN FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS
OF ZENITH IF NOT OF PERIGEETHAT IS TO SAY ABOUT ONCE A YEARCOULD
THEY NOT SEND US A PROJECTILE LOADED WITH PROVISIONS WHICH WE SHOULD
EXPECT BY A FIXED DATE

HURRAH CRIED JT MASTON THAT IS NOT AT ALL A BAD IDEA CERTAINLY
WE WILL NOT FORGET YOU

I DEPEND UPON YOU THUS YOU SEE WE SHALL HAVE NEWS REGULARLY FROM THE
GLOBE AND FOR OUR PART WE SHALL BE VERY AWKWARD IF WE DO NOT FIND MEANS
TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR GOOD FRIENDS ON EARTH

THESE WORDS INSPIRED SUCH CONFIDENCE THAT MICHEL ARDAN WITH HIS SUPERB
ASSURANCE WOULD HAVE CARRIED THE WHOLE GUN CLUB WITH HIM WHAT HE SAID
SEEMED SIMPLE ELEMENTARY AND SURE OF SUCCESS AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
SORDID ATTACHMENT TO THIS EARTH TO HESITATE TO FOLLOW THE THREE
TRAVELLERS UPON THEIR LUNAR EXPEDITION

WHEN THE DIFFERENT OBJECTS WERE PLACED IN THE PROJECTILE THE WATER WAS
INTRODUCED BETWEEN THE PARTITIONS AND THE GAS FOR LIGHTING PURPOSES LAID
IN BARBICANE TOOK ENOUGH CHLORATE OF POTASH AND CAUSTIC POTASH FOR TWO
MONTHS AS HE FEARED UNFORESEEN DELAY AN EXTREMELY INGENIOUS MACHINE
WORKING AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE ELEMENTS FOR GOOD AIR IN MOTION THE
PROJECTILE THEREFORE WAS READY AND THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO WAS TO
LOWER IT INTO THE GUN AN OPERATION FULL OF PERILS AND DIFFICULTY

THE ENORMOUS PROJECTILE WAS TAKEN TO THE SUMMIT OF STONY HILL THERE
ENORMOUS CRANES SEIZED IT AND HELD IT SUSPENDED OVER THE METAL WELL

THIS WAS AN ANXIOUS MOMENT IF THE CHAINS WERE TO BREAK UNDER THE
ENORMOUS WEIGHT THE FALL OF SUCH A MASS WOULD INEVITABLY IGNITE THE
GUNCOTTON

HAPPILY NOTHING OF THE SORT HAPPENED AND A FEW HOURS AFTERWARDS THE
PROJECTILECOMPARTMENT RESTED ON ITS PYROXYLE BED A VERITABLE
FULMINATING PILLOW THE ONLY EFFECT OF ITS PRESSURE WAS TO RAM THE
CHARGE OF THE GUN MORE STRONGLY

I HAVE LOST SAID THE CAPTAIN HANDING THE SUM OF  DOLLARS TO
PRESIDENT BARBICANE

BARBICANE DID NOT WISH TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY FROM HIS TRAVELLING
COMPANION BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE WAY TO NICHOLL WHO WISHED TO
FULFIL ALL HIS ENGAGEMENTS BEFORE LEAVING THE EARTH

THEN SAID MICHEL ARDAN THERE IS BUT ONE THING I WISH FOR YOU NOW
CAPTAIN

WHAT IS THAT ASKED NICHOLL

IT IS THAT YOU MAY LOSE YOUR OTHER TWO WAGERS BY THAT MEANS WE SHALL
BE SURE NOT TO BE STOPPED ON THE ROAD




CHAPTER XXVI

FIRE


THE ST OF DECEMBER CAME THE FATAL DAY FOR IF THE PROJECTILE DID NOT
START THAT VERY EVENING AT H M AND S PM MORE THAN EIGHTEEN
YEARS WOULD ELAPSE BEFORE THE MOON WOULD PRESENT THE SAME SIMULTANEOUS
CONDITIONS OF ZENITH AND PERIGEE

THE WEATHER WAS MAGNIFICENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE APPROACH OF WINTER THE
SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY AND BATHED IN ITS RADIANCE THAT EARTH WHICH THREE OF
ITS INHABITANTS WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR A NEW WORLD

HOW MANY PEOPLE SLEPT BADLY DURING THE NIGHT THAT PRECEDED THE
ARDENTLYLONGEDFOR DAY HOW MANY BREASTS WERE OPPRESSED WITH THE HEAVY
BURDEN OF WAITING ALL HEARTS BEAT WITH ANXIETY EXCEPT ONLY THE HEART OF
MICHEL ARDAN THIS IMPASSIBLE PERSON WENT AND CAME IN HIS USUAL
BUSINESSLIKE WAY BUT NOTHING IN HIM DENOTED ANY UNUSUAL PREOCCUPATION
HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN PEACEFULIT WAS THE SLEEP OF TURENNE UPON A
GUNCARRIAGE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BATTLE

FROM EARLY DAWN AN INNUMERABLE CROWD COVERED THE PRAIRIE WHICH EXTENDED
AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH ROUND STONY HILL EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR
THE RAILROAD OF TAMPA BROUGHT FRESH SIGHTSEERS ACCORDING TO THE TAMPA
TOWN OBSERVER FIVE MILLIONS OF SPECTATORS WERE THAT DAY UPON FLORIDIAN
SOIL

THE GREATER PART OF THIS CROWD HAD BEEN LIVING IN TENTS ROUND THE
INCLOSURE AND LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF A TOWN WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN
CALLED ARDANS TOWN THE GROUND BRISTLED WITH HUTS CABINS AND TENTS
AND THESE EPHEMERAL HABITATIONS SHELTERED A POPULATION NUMEROUS ENOUGH
TO RIVAL THE LARGEST CITIES OF EUROPE

EVERY NATION UPON EARTH WAS REPRESENTED EVERY LANGUAGE WAS SPOKEN AT
THE SAME TIME IT WAS LIKE THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES AT THE TOWER OF
BABEL THERE THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF AMERICAN SOCIETY MIXED IN ABSOLUTE
EQUALITY BANKERS CULTIVATORS SAILORS AGENTS MERCHANTS
COTTONPLANTERS AND MAGISTRATES ELBOWED EACH OTHER WITH PRIMITIVE EASE
THE CREOLES OF LOUISIANA FRATERNISED WITH THE FARMERS OF INDIANA THE
GENTLEMEN OF KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE THE ELEGANT AND HAUGHTY VIRGINIANS
JOKED WITH THE HALFSAVAGE TRAPPERS OF THE LAKES AND THE BUTCHERS OF
CINCINNATI THEY APPEARED IN BROADBRIMMED WHITE BEAVERS AND PANAMAS
BLUE COTTON TROUSERS FROM THE OPELOUSA MANUFACTORIES DRAPED IN ELEGANT
BLOUSES OF ECRU CLOTH IN BOOTS OF BRILLIANT COLOURS AND EXTRAVAGANT
SHIRTFRILLS UPON SHIRTFRONTS CUFFS CRAVATS ON THEIR TEN FINGERS
EVEN IN THEIR EARS AN ASSORTMENT OF RINGS PINS DIAMONDS CHAINS
BUCKLES AND TRINKETS THE COST OF WHICH EQUALLED THE BAD TASTE WIFE
CHILDREN SERVANTS IN NO LESS RICH DRESS ACCOMPANIED FOLLOWED
PRECEDED AND SURROUNDED THEIR HUSBANDS FATHERS AND MASTERS WHO
RESEMBLED THE PATRIARCHS AMIDST THEIR INNUMERABLE FAMILIES

AT MEALTIMES IT WAS A SIGHT TO SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE DEVOUR THE DISHES
PECULIAR TO THE SOUTHERN STATES AND EAT WITH AN APPETITE MENACING TO
THE PROVISIONING OF FLORIDA THE FOOD THAT WOULD BE REPUGNANT TO A
EUROPEAN STOMACH SUCH AS FRICASSEED FROGS MONKEYFLESH FISHCHOWDER
UNDERDONE OPOSSUM AND RACCOON STEAKS

THE LIQUORS THAT ACCOMPANIED THIS INDIGESTIBLE FOOD WERE NUMEROUS
SHOUTS AND VOCIFERATIONS TO BUY RESOUNDED THROUGH THE BARROOMS OR
TAVERNS DECORATED WITH GLASSES TANKARDS DECANTERS AND BOTTLES OF
MARVELLOUS SHAPES MORTARS FOR POUNDING SUGAR AND BUNDLES OF STRAWS

MINTJULEP ROARS OUT ONE OF THE SALESMEN

CLARET SANGAREE SHOUTS ANOTHER THROUGH HIS NOSE

GINSLING SHOUTS ONE

COCKTAIL BRANDYSMASH CRIES ANOTHER

WHOLL BUY REAL MINTJULEP IN THE LATEST STYLE SHOUTED THESE SKILFUL
SALESMEN RAPIDLY PASSING FROM ONE GLASS TO ANOTHER THE SUGAR LEMON
GREEN MINT CRUSHED ICE WATER COGNAC AND FRESH PINEAPPLE WHICH
COMPOSE THIS REFRESHING DRINK

GENERALLY THESE SOUNDS ADDRESSED TO THROATS MADE THIRSTY BY THE SPICES
THEY CONSUMED MINGLED INTO ONE DEAFENING ROAR BUT ON THIS ST OF
DECEMBER THESE CRIES WERE RARE NO ONE THOUGHT OF EATING AND DRINKING
AND AT  PM THERE WERE MANY SPECTATORS IN THE CROWD WHO HAD NOT TAKEN
THEIR CUSTOMARY LUNCH A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT FACT EVEN THE NATIONAL
PASSION FOR GAMING WAS ALLAYED BY THE GENERAL EMOTION THIMBLES
SKITTLES AND CARDS WERE LEFT IN THEIR WRAPPINGS AND TESTIFIED THAT THE
GREAT EVENT OF THE DAY ABSORBED ALL ATTENTION

UNTIL NIGHTFALL A DULL NOISELESS AGITATION LIKE THAT WHICH PRECEDES
GREAT CATASTROPHES RAN THROUGH THE ANXIOUS CROWD AN INDESCRIBABLE
UNEASINESS OPPRESSED ALL MINDS AND STOPPED THE BEATING OF ALL HEARTS
EVERY ONE WISHED IT OVER

HOWEVER ABOUT SEVEN OCLOCK THIS HEAVY SILENCE WAS SUDDENLY BROKEN THE
MOON ROSE ABOVE THE HORIZON SEVERAL MILLIONS OF HURRAHS SALUTED HER
APPARITION SHE WAS PUNCTUAL TO THE APPOINTMENT SHOUTS OF WELCOME BROKE
FROM ALL PARTS WHILST THE BLONDE PHOEBE SHONE PEACEFULLY IN A CLEAR
SKY AND CARESSED THE ENRAPTURED CROWD WITH HER MOST AFFECTIONATE RAYS

AT THAT MOMENT THE THREE INTREPID TRAVELLERS APPEARED WHEN THEY
APPEARED THE CRIES REDOUBLED IN INTENSITY UNANIMOUSLY INSTANTANEOUSLY
THE NATIONAL SONG OF THE UNITED STATES ESCAPED FROM ALL THE SPECTATORS
AND YANKEE DOODLE SUNG BY  OF HEARTY THROATS ROSE LIKE A
ROARING TEMPEST TO THE FARTHEST LIMITS OF THE ATMOSPHERE

THEN AFTER THIS IRRESISTIBLE OUTBURST THE HYMN WAS ENDED THE LAST
HARMONIES DIED AWAY BY DEGREES AND A SILENT MURMUR FLOATED OVER THE
PROFOUNDLYEXCITED CROWD

IN THE MEANTIME THE FRENCHMAN AND THE TWO AMERICANS HAD STEPPED INTO THE
INCLOSURE ROUND WHICH THE CROWD WAS PRESSING THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY
THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB AND DEPUTATIONS SENT BY THE EUROPEAN
OBSERVATORIES BARBICANE WAS COOLLY AND CALMLY GIVING HIS LAST ORDERS
NICHOLL WITH COMPRESSED LIPS AND HANDS CROSSED BEHIND HIS BACK WALKED
WITH A FIRM AND MEASURED STEP MICHEL ARDAN ALWAYS AT HIS EASE CLOTHED
IN A PERFECT TRAVELLING SUIT WITH LEATHER GAITERS ON HIS LEGS POUCH AT
HIS SIDE IN VAST GARMENT OF MAROON VELVET A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH
DISTRIBUTED SHAKES OF THE HAND WITH PRINCELY PRODIGALITY HE WAS FULL OF
INEXHAUSTIBLE GAIETY LAUGHING JOKING PLAYING PRANKS UPON THE WORTHY
JT MASTON AND WAS IN A WORD FRENCH AND WHAT IS WORSE
PARISIAN TILL THE LAST SECOND

TEN OCLOCK STRUCK THE MOMENT HAD COME TO TAKE THEIR PLACES IN THE
PROJECTILE THE NECESSARY MECHANISM FOR THE DESCENT THE DOORPLATE TO
SCREW DOWN THE REMOVAL OF THE CRANES AND SCAFFOLDING HUNG OVER THE
MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIAD TOOK SOME TIME

BARBICANE HAD SET HIS CHRONOMETER TO THE TENTH OF A SECOND BY THAT OF
THE ENGINEER MURCHISON WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH SETTING FIRE TO THE
POWDER BY MEANS OF THE ELECTRIC SPARK THE TRAVELLERS SHUT UP IN THE
PROJECTILE COULD THUS WATCH THE IMPASSIVE NEEDLE WHICH WAS GOING TO MARK
THE PRECISE INSTANT OF THEIR DEPARTURE

THE MOMENT FOR SAYING FAREWELL HAD COME THE SCENE WAS TOUCHING IN
SPITE OF HIS GAIETY MICHEL ARDAN FELT TOUCHED JT MASTON HAD FOUND
UNDER HIS DRY EYELIDS AN ANCIENT TEAR THAT HE HAD DOUBTLESS KEPT FOR
THE OCCASION HE SHED IT UPON THE FOREHEAD OF HIS DEAR PRESIDENT

SUPPOSE I GO TOO SAID HE THERE IS STILL TIME

IMPOSSIBLE OLD FELLOW ANSWERED BARBICANE

A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE THREE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS WERE INSTALLED IN
THE PROJECTILE AND HAD SCREWED DOWN THE DOORPLATE AND THE MOUTH OF
THE COLUMBIAD ENTIRELY LIBERATED ROSE FREELY TOWARDS THE SKY

NICHOLL BARBICANE AND MICHEL ARDAN WERE DEFINITIVELY WALLED UP IN
THEIR METAL VEHICLE

WHO COULD PREDICT THE UNIVERSAL EMOTION THEN AT ITS PAROXYSM

THE MOON WAS RISING IN A FIRMAMENT OF LIMPID PURITY OUTSHINING ON HER
PASSAGE THE TWINKLING FIRE OF THE STARS SHE PASSED OVER THE
CONSTELLATION OF THE TWINS AND WAS NOW NEARLY HALFWAY BETWEEN THE
HORIZON AND THE ZENITH

A FRIGHTFUL SILENCE HUNG OVER ALL THAT SCENE THERE WAS NOT A BREATH OF
WIND ON THE EARTH NOT A SOUND OF BREATHING FROM THE CROWD HEARTS DARED
NOT BEAT EVERY EYE WAS FIXED ON THE GAPING MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIAD

MURCHISON WATCHED THE NEEDLE OF HIS CHRONOMETER HARDLY FORTY SECONDS
HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE THE MOMENT OF DEPARTURE STRUCK AND EACH ONE LASTED
A CENTURY

AT THE TWENTIETH THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL SHUDDER AND THE THOUGHT OCCURRED
TO ALL THE CROWD THAT THE AUDACIOUS TRAVELLERS SHUT UP IN THE VEHICLE
WERE LIKEWISE COUNTING THESE TERRIBLE SECONDS SOME ISOLATED CRIES WERE
HEARD

THIRTYFIVETHIRTYSIXTHIRTYSEVENTHIRTYEIGHTTHIRTYNINE
FORTY FIRE

MURCHISON IMMEDIATELY PRESSED HIS FINGER UPON THE ELECTRIC KNOB AND
HURLED THE ELECTRIC SPARK INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE COLUMBIAD

A FEARFUL UNHEARDOF SUPERHUMAN REPORT OF WHICH NOTHING COULD GIVE
AN IDEA NOT EVEN THUNDER OR THE ERUPTION OF VOLCANOES WAS IMMEDIATELY
PRODUCED AN IMMENSE SPOUT OF FIRE SPRANG UP FROM THE BOWELS OF THE
EARTH AS IF FROM A CRATER THE SOIL HEAVED AND VERY FEW PERSONS CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE OF THE PROJECTILE VICTORIOUSLY CLEAVING THE AIR AMIDST THE
FLAMING SMOKE




CHAPTER XXVII

CLOUDY WEATHER


AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE PYRAMID OF FLAME ROSE TO A PRODIGIOUS HEIGHT IN
THE AIR IT LIGHTED UP THE WHOLE OF FLORIDA AND FOR AN INCALCULABLE
MOMENT DAY WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR NIGHT OVER A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT OF
COUNTRY THIS IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE WAS PERCEIVED FOR A HUNDRED MILES
OUT AT SEA FROM THE GULF AND FROM THE ATLANTIC AND MORE THAN ONE
SHIPS CAPTAIN NOTED THE APPARITION OF THIS GIGANTIC METEOR IN HIS
LOGBOOK

THE DISCHARGE OF THE COLUMBIAD WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A VERITABLE
EARTHQUAKE FLORIDA WAS SHAKEN TO ITS VERY DEPTHS THE GASES OF THE
POWDER EXPANDED BY HEAT FORCED BACK THE ATMOSPHERIC STRATA WITH
TREMENDOUS VIOLENCE PASSING LIKE A WATERSPOUT THROUGH THE AIR

NOT ONE SPECTATOR REMAINED ON HIS LEGS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE
THROWN DOWN LIKE EARS OF WHEAT IN A STORM THERE WAS A TERRIBLE TUMULT
AND A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED JT MASTON WHO
HAD VERY IMPRUDENTLY KEPT TO THE FORE WAS THROWN TWENTY YARDS BACKWARDS
LIKE A BULLET OVER THE HEADS OF HIS FELLOWCITIZENS THREE HUNDRED
THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE TEMPORARILY DEAFENED AND AS THOUGH THUNDERSTRUCK

THE ATMOSPHERIC CURRENT AFTER THROWING OVER HUTS AND CABINS UPROOTING
TREES WITHIN A RADIUS OF TWENTY MILES THROWING THE TRAINS OFF THE
RAILWAY AS FAR AS TAMPA BURST UPON THE TOWN LIKE AN AVALANCHE AND
DESTROYED A HUNDRED HOUSES AMONGST OTHERS THE CHURCH OF ST MARY AND
THE NEW EDIFICE OF THE EXCHANGE SOME OF THE VESSELS IN THE PORT WERE
RUN AGAINST EACH OTHER AND SUNK AND TEN OF THEM WERE STRANDED HIGH AND
DRY AFTER BREAKING THEIR CHAINS LIKE THREADS OF COTTON

BUT THE CIRCLE OF THESE DEVASTATIONS EXTENDED FARTHER STILL AND BEYOND
THE LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES THE RECOIL AIDED BY THE WESTERLY
WINDS WAS FELT ON THE ATLANTIC AT MORE THAN  MILES FROM THE AMERICAN
SHORES AN UNEXPECTED TEMPEST WHICH EVEN ADMIRAL FITZROY COULD NOT HAVE
FORESEEN BROKE UPON THE SHIPS WITH UNHEARDOF VIOLENCE SEVERAL
VESSELS SEIZED BY A SORT OF WHIRLWIND BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO FURL
THEIR SAILS WERE SUNK AMONGST OTHERS THE CHILDE HAROLD OF
LIVERPOOL A REGRETTABLE CATASTROPHE WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF LIVELY
RECRIMINATIONS

LASTLYALTHOUGH THE FACT IS NOT WARRANTED EXCEPT BY THE AFFIRMATION OF
A FEW NATIVESHALFANHOUR AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE PROJECTILE THE
INHABITANTS OF SIERRALEONE PRETENDED THAT THEY HEARD A DULL NOISE THE
LAST DISPLACEMENT OF THE SONOROUS WAVES WHICH AFTER CROSSING THE
ATLANTIC DIED AWAY ON THE AFRICAN COAST

BUT TO RETURN TO FLORIDA THE TUMULT ONCE LESSENED THE WOUNDED AND
DEAFIN SHORT ALL THE CROWDROSE AND SHOUTED IN A SORT OF FRENZY
HURRAH FOR ARDAN HURRAH FOR BARBICANE HURRAH FOR NICHOLL SEVERAL
MILLIONS OF MEN NOSE IN AIR ARMED WITH TELESCOPES AND EVERY SPECIES OF
FIELDGLASS LOOKED INTO SPACE FORGETTING CONTUSIONS AND FEELINGS IN
ORDER TO LOOK AT THE PROJECTILE BUT THEY SOUGHT IN VAIN IT WAS NOT TO
BE SEEN AND THEY RESOLVED TO AWAIT THE TELEGRAMS FROM LONGS PEAK THE
DIRECTOR OF THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY M BELFAST WAS AT HIS POST IN
THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND IT WAS TO THIS SKILFUL AND PERSEVERING
ASTRONOMER THAT THE OBSERVATIONS HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED

BUT AN UNFORESEEN PHENOMENON AGAINST WHICH NOTHING COULD BE DONE SOON
CAME TO PUT PUBLIC IMPATIENCE TO A RUDE TEST

THE WEATHER SO FINE BEFORE SUDDENLY CHANGED THE SKY BECAME COVERED
WITH CLOUDS IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE AFTER SO GREAT A DISPLACEMENT OF
THE ATMOSPHERIC STRATA AND THE DISPERSION OF THE ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF
GASES FROM THE COMBUSTION OF  LBS OF PYROXYLE ALL NATURAL ORDER
HAD BEEN DISTURBED THERE IS NOTHING ASTONISHING IN THAT FOR IN
SEAFIGHTS IT HAS BEEN NOTICED THAT THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN
SUDDENLY CHANGED BY THE ARTILLERY DISCHARGE

THE NEXT DAY THE SUN ROSE UPON AN HORIZON COVERED WITH THICK CLOUDS A
HEAVY AND AN IMPENETRABLE CURTAIN HUNG BETWEEN EARTH AND SKY AND WHICH
UNFORTUNATELY EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE REGIONS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS IT
WAS A FATALITY A CONCERT OF COMPLAINTS ROSE FROM ALL PARTS OF THE
GLOBE BUT NATURE TOOK NO NOTICE AND AS MEN HAD CHOSEN TO DISTURB THE
ATMOSPHERE WITH THEIR GUN THEY MUST SUBMIT TO THE CONSEQUENCES

DURING THIS FIRST DAY EVERY ONE TRIED TO PIERCE THE THICK VEIL OF
CLOUDS BUT NO ONE WAS REWARDED FOR THE TROUBLE BESIDES THEY WERE ALL
MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING THEY COULD SEE IT BY LOOKING UP AT THE SKY FOR ON
ACCOUNT OF THE DIURNAL MOVEMENT OF THE GLOBE THE PROJECTILE WAS THEN OF
COURSE SHOOTING PAST THE LINE OF THE ANTIPODES

HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE WHEN NIGHT AGAIN ENVELOPED THE EARTHA DARK
IMPENETRABLE NIGHTIT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE MOON ABOVE THE HORIZON
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS HIDING ON PURPOSE FROM THE BOLD
BEINGS WHO HAD SHOT AT HER NO OBSERVATION WAS THEREFORE POSSIBLE AND
THE DESPATCHES FROM LONGS PEAK CONFIRMED THE DISASTROUS INTELLIGENCE

HOWEVER IF THE EXPERIMENT HAD SUCCEEDED THE TRAVELLERS WHO HAD
STARTED ON THE ST OF DECEMBER AT H M S PM WERE DUE AT
THEIR DESTINATION ON THE TH AT MIDNIGHT SO THAT AS UP TO THAT TIME IT
WOULD AFTER ALL HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE A BODY SO SMALL PEOPLE
WAITED WITH ALL THE PATIENCE THEY COULD MUSTER

ON THE TH OF DECEMBER FROM  PM TILL MIDNIGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW THE TRACE OF THE PROJECTILE WHICH WOULD HAVE
APPEARED LIKE A BLACK SPECK ON THE SHINING DISC OF THE MOON BUT THE
WEATHER REMAINED IMPERTURBABLY CLOUDY AND EXASPERATED THE PUBLIC WHO
SWORE AT THE MOON FOR NOT SHOWING HERSELF SIC TRANSIT GLORIA MUNDI

JT MASTON IN DESPAIR SET OUT FOR LONGS PEAK HE WISHED TO MAKE AN
OBSERVATION HIMSELF HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT HIS FRIENDS HAD ARRIVED AT
THE GOAL OF THEIR JOURNEY NO ONE HAD HEARD THAT THE PROJECTILE HAD
FALLEN UPON ANY CONTINENT OR ISLAND UPON EARTH AND JT MASTON DID NOT
ADMIT FOR A MOMENT THAT IT COULD HAVE FALLEN INTO ANY OF THE OCEANS WITH
WHICH THE EARTH IS THREE PARTS COVERED

ON THE TH THE SAME WEATHER THE LARGE TELESCOPES OF THE OLD
WORLDTHOSE OF HERSCHEL ROSSE AND FOUCAULTWERE INVARIABLY FIXED
UPON THE QUEEN OF NIGHT FOR THE WEATHER WAS MAGNIFICENT IN EUROPE BUT
THE RELATIVE WEAKNESS OF THESE INSTRUMENTS PREVENTED ANY USEFUL
OBSERVATION

ON THE TH THE SAME WEATHER REIGNED IMPATIENCE DEVOURED THREE PARTS OF
THE GLOBE THE MOST INSANE MEANS WERE PROPOSED FOR DISSIPATING THE
CLOUDS ACCUMULATED IN THE AIR

ON THE TH THE SKY SEEMED TO CLEAR A LITTLE HOPES REVIVED BUT DID NOT
LAST LONG AND IN THE EVENING THICK CLOUDS DEFENDED THE STARRY VAULT
AGAINST ALL EYES

THINGS NOW BECAME GRAVE IN FACT ON THE TH AT  AM THE MOON
WOULD ENTER HER LAST QUARTER AFTER THIS DELAY SHE WOULD DECLINE EVERY
DAY AND EVEN IF THE SKY SHOULD CLEAR THE CHANCES OF OBSERVATION WOULD
BE CONSIDERABLY LESSENEDIN FACT THE MOON WOULD THEN SHOW ONLY A
CONSTANTLYDECREASING PORTION OF HER DISC AND WOULD END BY BECOMING
NEWTHAT IS TO SAY SHE WOULD RISE AND SET WITH THE SUN WHOSE RAYS
WOULD MAKE HER QUITE INVISIBLE THEY WOULD THEREFORE BE OBLIGED TO
WAIT TILL THE RD OF JANUARY AT  PM TILL SHE WOULD BE FULL
AGAIN AND READY FOR OBSERVATION

THE NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED THESE REFLECTIONS WITH A THOUSAND COMMENTARIES
AND DID NOT FAIL TO TELL THE PUBLIC THAT IT MUST ARM ITSELF WITH ANGELIC
PATIENCE

ON THE TH NO CHANGE ON THE TH THE SUN APPEARED FOR A MOMENT AS IF TO
JEER AT THE AMERICANS IT WAS RECEIVED WITH HISSES AND WOUNDED
DOUBTLESS BY SUCH A RECEPTION IT WAS VERY MISERLY OF ITS RAYS

ON THE TH NO CHANGE JT MASTON NEARLY WENT MAD AND FEARS WERE
ENTERTAINED FOR HIS BRAIN UNTIL THEN SO WELL PRESERVED IN ITS
GUTTAPERCHA CRANIUM

BUT ON THE TH ONE OF THOSE FRIGHTFUL TEMPESTS PECULIAR TO TROPICAL
REGIONS WAS LET LOOSE IN THE ATMOSPHERE TERRIFIC EAST WINDS SWEPT AWAY
THE CLOUDS WHICH HAD BEEN SO LONG THERE AND IN THE EVENING THE
HALFDISC OF THE MOON RODE MAJESTICALLY AMIDST THE LIMPID CONSTELLATIONS
OF THE SKY




CHAPTER XXVIII

A NEW STAR


THAT SAME NIGHT THE NEWS SO IMPATIENTLY EXPECTED BURST LIKE A
THUNDERBOLT OVER THE UNITED STATES OF THE UNION AND THENCE DARTING
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IT RAN ALONG ALL THE TELEGRAPHIC WIRES OF THE GLOBE
THE PROJECTILE HAD BEEN PERCEIVED THANKS TO THE GIGANTIC REFLECTOR OF
LONGS PEAK

THE FOLLOWING IS THE NOTICE DRAWN UP BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE CAMBRIDGE
OBSERVATORY IT RESUMES THE SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSION OF THE GREAT
EXPERIMENT MADE BY THE GUN CLUB

LONGS PEAK DECEMBER TH

TO THE STAFF OF THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY

THE PROJECTILE HURLED BY THE COLUMBIAD OF STONY HILL WAS PERCEIVED BY
MESSRS BELFAST AND JT MASTON ON THE TH OF DECEMBER AT  PM
THE MOON HAVING ENTERED HER LAST QUARTER

THE PROJECTILE HAS NOT REACHED ITS GOAL IT HAS DEVIATED TO THE SIDE
BUT NEAR ENOUGH TO BE DETAINED BY LUNAR ATTRACTION

THERE ITS RECTILINEAR MOVEMENT CHANGED TO A CIRCULAR ONE OF EXTREME
VELOCITY AND IT HAS BEEN DRAWN ROUND THE MOON IN AN ELLIPTICAL ORBIT
AND HAS BECOME HER SATELLITE

WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE THE ELEMENTS OF THIS NEW STAR
NEITHER ITS SPEED OF TRANSLATION OR ROTATION IS KNOWN THE DISTANCE
WHICH SEPARATES IT FROM THE SURFACE OF THE MOON MAY BE ESTIMATED AT
ABOUT  MILES

NOW TWO HYPOTHESES MAY BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS TO A MODIFICATION
IN THIS STATE OF THINGS

EITHER THE ATTRACTION OF THE MOON WILL END BY DRAWING IT TOWARDS HER
AND THE TRAVELLERS WILL REACH THE GOAL OF THEIR JOURNEY

OR THE PROJECTILE MAINTAINED IN AN IMMUTABLE ORBIT WILL GRAVITATE
ROUND THE LUNAR DISC TILL THE END OF TIME

OBSERVATION WILL SETTLE THIS POINT SOME DAY BUT UNTIL NOW THE
EXPERIMENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAS HAD NO OTHER RESULT THAN THAT OF
PROVIDING OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WITH A NEW STAR

J BELFAST

WHAT DISCUSSIONS THIS UNEXPECTED DENOUEMENT GAVE RISE TO WHAT A
SITUATION FULL OF MYSTERY THE FUTURE RESERVED FOR THE INVESTIGATIONS OF
SCIENCE THANKS TO THE COURAGE AND DEVOTION OF THREE MEN THIS
ENTERPRISE OF SENDING A BULLET TO THE MOON FUTILE ENOUGH IN APPEARANCE
HAD JUST HAD AN IMMENSE RESULT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH ARE
INCALCULABLE THE TRAVELLERS IMPRISONED IN A NEW SATELLITE IF THEY HAVE
NOT ATTAINED THEIR END FORM AT LEAST PART OF THE LUNAR WORLD THEY
GRAVITATE AROUND THE QUEEN OF NIGHT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HUMAN EYES
CAN PENETRATE ALL HER MYSTERIES THE NAMES OF NICHOLL BARBICANE AND
MICHEL ARDAN WOULD BE FOR EVER CELEBRATED IN ASTRONOMICAL ANNALS FOR
THESE BOLD EXPLORERS DESIROUS OF WIDENING THE CIRCLE OF HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE HAD AUDACIOUSLY RUSHED INTO SPACE AND HAD RISKED THEIR LIVES
IN THE STRANGEST EXPERIMENT OF MODERN TIMES

THE NOTICE FROM LONGS PEAK ONCE MADE KNOWN THERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE
UNIVERSE A FEELING OF SURPRISE AND HORROR WAS IT POSSIBLE TO GO TO THE
AID OF THESE BOLD INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH CERTAINLY NOT FOR THEY HAD
PUT THEMSELVES OUTSIDE OF THE PALE OF HUMANITY BY CROSSING THE LIMITS
IMPOSED BY THE CREATOR ON HIS TERRESTRIAL CREATURES THEY COULD PROCURE
THEMSELVES AIR FOR TWO MONTHS THEY HAD PROVISIONS FOR ONE YEAR BUT
AFTER THE HARDEST HEARTS PALPITATED AT THIS TERRIBLE QUESTION

ONE MAN ALONE WOULD NOT ADMIT THAT THE SITUATION WAS DESPERATE ONE
ALONE HAD CONFIDENCE AND IT WAS THEIR FRIENDDEVOTED AUDACIOUS AND
RESOLUTE AS THEYTHE BRAVE JT MASTON

HE RESOLVED NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THEM HIS DOMICILE WAS HENCEFORTH THE
POST OF LONGS PEAKHIS HORIZON THE IMMENSE REFLECTOR AS SOON AS THE
MOON ROSE ABOVE THE HORIZON HE IMMEDIATELY FRAMED HER IN THE FIELD OF
HIS TELESCOPE HE DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HER FOR AN INSTANT AND
ASSIDUOUSLY FOLLOWED HER ACROSS THE STELLAR SPACES HE WATCHED WITH
ETERNAL PATIENCE THE PASSAGE OF THE PROJECTILE OVER HER DISC OF SILVER
AND IN REALITY THE WORTHY MAN REMAINED IN PERPETUAL COMMUNICATION WITH
HIS THREE FRIENDS WHOM HE DID NOT DESPAIR OF SEEING AGAIN ONE DAY

WE WILL CORRESPOND WITH THEM SAID HE TO ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN AS
SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ALLOW WE SHALL HAVE NEWS FROM THEM AND THEY
WILL HAVE NEWS FROM US BESIDES I KNOW THEMTHEY ARE INGENIOUS MEN
THOSE THREE CARRY WITH THEM INTO SPACE ALL THE RESOURCES OF ART
SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY WITH THOSE EVERYTHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AND
YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY WILL GET OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY
