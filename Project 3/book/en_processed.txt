twenty times speed shall hurl rapidity seven miles second ah splendid shot superb projectile think received honours due terrestrial ambassador cheers greeted brilliant peroration maston overcome emotion sat amidst felicitations colleagues said barbicane given time poetry let us proceed facts ready answered members committee demolished half dozen sandwiches know problem solve continued president endowing projectile speed yards per second reason believe shall succeed present let us see speeds already obtained general morgan edify us subject easily answered general war member experiment commission pound cannon dahlgren range yards gave projectiles initial speed yards second yes rodman columbiad americans gave name columbiad enormous engines destruction asked president rodman columbiad tried fort hamilton near new york hurled projectile weighing half ton distance six miles speed yards second result neither armstrong palliser obtained england englishmen nowhere said maston pointing formidable steel hook eastward resumed barbicane speed yards maximum obtained present yes answered morgan might add however replied maston mortar blown yes blown replied barbicane benevolent gesture take speed yards starting point keep till another meeting discussion means used produce speed allow call attention dimensions projectile course something different half ton weight asked major quickly answered maston large enough attract attention inhabitants moon supposing yes answered barbicane another reason still important mean barbicane asked major mean enough send projectile think follow transit said general slightly surprised proposition certainly replied barbicane man knew saying experiment without result replied major give projectile enormous dimensions please grant attention know optical instruments acquired great perfection certain telescopes increase objects six thousand bring moon within distance forty miles distance objects sixty feet square perfectly visible power penetration telescope increased power exercised detriment clearness moon reflecting mirror send light intense enough telescopes increase objects beyond limit well mean asked general intend giving diameter sixty feet projectile going take task making moon luminous though rather strong exclaimed maston yes simple answered barbicane succeed lessening density atmosphere moon light traverses shall render light intense evidently order obtain result shall establish telescope high mountain give answered major way simplifying things enlargement hope obtain thus times bring moon within five miles objects need diameter nine feet perfect exclaimed maston projectile diameter nine feet precisely allow inform however returned major elphinstone weight still oh major answered barbicane discussing weight allow tell forefathers marvels way far pretend ballistics progressed well know middle ages surprising results obtained dare affirm even surprising justify statement exclaimed maston nothing easier answered barbicane give examples siege constantinople mahomet ii hurled stone bullets weighed lbs malta time knights certain cannon fort saint elme hurled projectiles weighing lbs according french historian louis xi mortar hurled bomb lbs bomb fired bastille place mad men imprisoned wise ones fell charenton wise men imprison mad ones well said maston since seen armstrong cannons hurl projectiles lbs rodman columbiads projectiles half ton seems projectiles increased range lost weight turn efforts direction succeed progress science doubling weight projectiles mahomet ii knights malta evident answered major metal intend employ projectile simply cast iron said general morgan cast iron exclaimed maston disdainfully common bullet destined go moon let us exaggerate honourable friend answered morgan cast iron sufficient replied major elphinstone weight projectile proportion volume cast iron bullet measuring nine feet diameter still frightfully heavy yes solid hollow said barbicane hollow obus put despatches replied maston specimens terrestrial productions yes obus answered barbicane solid bullet inches weigh lbs weight evidently great however necessary give projectile certain stability propose give weight lbs thickness metal asked major follow usual proportions replied morgan diameter inches demands sides two feet thick least thick answered barbicane want projectile pierce armour plate needs sides strong enough resist pressure powder gas problem thickness ought iron obus order weigh lbs clever calculator mr maston tell us nothing easier replied honourable secretary saying traced algebraical signs paper amongst n x frequently appeared even seemed extract certain cubic root said sides hardly two inches thick sufficient asked major doubtfully answered president certainly done resumed elphinstone looking puzzled use another metal instead cast iron brass suggested morgan heavy something better propose asked major aluminium answered barbicane aluminium cried three colleagues president certainly friends know illustrious french chemist henry st claire deville succeeded obtaining aluminium compact mass precious metal possesses whiteness silver indestructibility gold tenacity iron fusibility copper lightness glass easily wrought widely distributed nature aluminium forms basis rocks three times lighter iron seems created expressly furnish us material projectile hurrah aluminium cried secretary always noisy moments enthusiasm dear president said major aluminium quoted exceedingly high answered barbicane first discovered pound aluminium cost dollars fell twenty seven dollars worth nine dollars nine dollars pound replied major easily give still enormous price doubtless dear major reach projectile weigh asked morgan result calculations answered barbicane projectile inches diameter inches thick weigh made cast iron lbs cast aluminium reduced lbs perfect cried maston suits programme capitally yes replied major know nine dollars pound projectile cost hundred seventy three thousand fifty dollars yes know fear nothing friends money enterprise wanting answer showered us replied maston well say aluminium asked president adopted answered three members committee form projectile resumed barbicane little consequence since atmosphere cleared find empty space propose round ball turn pleases thus ended first committee meeting question projectile definitely resolved maston delighted idea sending aluminium bullet selenites give end idea inhabitants earth chapter viii history cannon resolutions passed meeting produced great effect outside timid people grew alarmed idea projectile weighing lbs hurled space people asked cannon ever transmit initial speed sufficient mass report second meeting destined answer questions victoriously next evening four members gun club sat fresh mountains sandwiches veritable ocean tea debate began dear colleagues said barbicane going occupy construction engine length form composition weight probable shall give gigantic dimensions however great difficulties might industrial genius easily overcome please listen spare objections present fear approving murmur greeted declaration forget resumed barbicane point yesterday debate brought us problem following give initial speed yards second shot inches diameter weighing lbs problem indeed answered major elphinstone projectile hurled space resumed barbicane happens acted three independent forces resistance medium attraction earth force impulsion animated let us examine three forces resistance medium say resistance air little importance fact terrestrial atmosphere forty miles deep rapidity yards projectile cross five seconds time short enough make resistance medium insignificant let us pass attraction earth say weight projectile know weight diminishes inverse ratio square distances fact physics teach us body left falls surface earth falls feet first second body fall miles say distance earth moon fall reduced half line first second almost equivalent immobility question progressively overcome law gravitation shall force impulsion difficulty answered major indeed replied president shall triumph force impulsion want depends length engine quantity powder employed limited resistance let us occupy day dimensions given cannon quite understood make large seeing moved evident replied general said barbicane longest cannon enormous columbiads twenty five feet long shall astonish many people dimensions shall adopt certainly exclaimed maston part ask cannon half mile long least half mile cried major general yes half mile half short come maston answered morgan exaggerate said irate secretary really know tax exaggeration go far know sir answered maston looking dignified artilleryman cannon ball never go far debate getting personal president interfered calm friends let us reason evidently want gun great range length engine increase detention gas accumulated behind
