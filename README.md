## Poject 1
Find the chromatic number ofa given undirected graph, using both an exhaustive search approach and a greedy heuristic.

## Project 2
Count the occurrence of each letter in books, using three strategies: exact counting, approximate counting with fixed probability, and approximate counting with decreasing probability.

## Project 3
